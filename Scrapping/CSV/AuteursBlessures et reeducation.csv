Gérard Gacon,"Il paraît difficile et présomptueux de vouloir écrire un livre sur les prothèses totales du genou. Les ouvrages de qualité traitant de ce sujet sont nombreux. La prothèse du genou a, dès son origine, particulièrement aux États-Unis, suscité des études considérables dans toutes les directions : biomécaniques, physiologiques, biologiques et industrielles.
Notre but est d&#39offrir aux plus jeunes un livre de connaissances simples sans prétention d&#39exhaustivité, sans prendre parti sur les sujets longtemps débattus (conservation ou non du LCP, ciment ou sans ciment, resurfaçage ou non de la rotule, plateau fixe ou plateau mobile, etc.), mais donnant des conseils pratiques issus de notre expérience.
Pourquoi se limiter aux tricompartimentaires de première intention ? Parce que c&#39est la solution la plus courante aux problèmes habituels des genoux dégénératifs.
Les prothèses unicompartimentaires et de révision sont des solutions à des problèmes différents qui feront l&#39objet d&#39autres ouvrages.
Chacun sait que mettre un modèle de prothèse du genou c&#39est quelque part adhérer aux idées de ses concepteurs. Chacun sait que mettre une prothèse du genou c&#39est quelque part adhérer à un système. Il importe cependant de pouvoir garder sa liberté d&#39analyse pour conserver sa liberté de choix. Mettre une prothèse du genou c&#39est quelque part un compromis qu&#39il faut savoir accepter.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Eric Topol,"""Dr. Topol&#39s vision of medicine&#39s future is optimistic. He thinks AI...is set to save time, lives and money.""―The Economist

""Topol passionately and persuasively sets out the transformational potential of deep medicine.""―Lancet

""[Topol&#39s] argument for using technology to bring care back to health care is timeless.""―Nature

""An optimistic vision of medicine&#39s rapidly approaching future that should be required reading for the public and medical people alike.""―Booklist

""Enlightening... Anyone with an avid curiosity about the future of medicine will find this worthwhile.""―Publishers Weekly

""A gimlet-eyed look at the role of computers in medicine...A cogent argument for a more humane -- and human -- medicine, assisted by technology but not driven by it.""―Kirkus

""Eric Topol has a unique knack for bringing us to the frontiers of medicine in his books, and this one is no exception. A compulsively readable, elegantly written, important account, Deep Medicine will fundamentally change the way you view the future of medical technologies and their impact on our lives. This book is challenging, thoughtful, and provocative. I cannot recommend it enough.""―Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of The Emperor of All Maladies

""Healthcare offers the best opportunity for symbiotic combination of artificial intelligence and humanity. Eric Topol&#39s book is the definitive work from someone who deeply understands both healthcare and AI. I strongly recommend the book, and hope it connects medical practitioners and AI researchers, and help them understand that only by working together, can our shared dreams of health and longevity be reached.""―Kai-Fu Lee, bestselling author of AI Superpowers

""Deep Medicine is a fascinating tour of how machine learning is transforming medical research, with medical care on the horizon. Topol reminds us that as our machines get smarter and capable of taking over more of our tasks, we must become more human, and more humane, to compensate. Our most brilliant AI tools will help us learn more about ourselves--body and mind--than we can even imagine, but they cannot empathize with a patient. This book is an excellent step toward directing all that knowledge into creating a healthier society, not just healthier individuals.""―Garry Kasparov, author of Deep Thinking

""The promise of Artificial Intelligence is deeply human, and its impact is only growing in industry and daily life alike. Deep Medicine is an insightful read about the incredible potential of AI and medicine, written from a refreshingly human-centered perspective. It&#39s not only a landmark book, but the start of a truly historic conversation about the implications of this exciting technology in medicine.""―Fei-Fei Li, professor of computer science at Stanford University and director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Stanford Vision Lab

""Deep Medicine is an essential look at the future of AI-powered healthcare, told by one of the most exciting researchers in the field.""―Andrew Ng, General Partner at AI Fund and CEO of Landing AI",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Susan Turner,"Balanced Ligamentous Tension has been welcomed with interest by osteopaths worldwide who seek to work precisely but with patient comfort and safety. As well as giving technical guidance and acting as a reference, this book seeks to nurture understanding of the reciprocal relationship between structural integrity and healthy function in the body. --Book Description

Many books have been written about Sutherland&#39s cranial concept, but not a lot about his approach to the rest of the body, Balanced Ligamentous Tension. Susan Turner&#39s book brilliantly fills this gap, sharing her lifetime of osteopathic experience with future generations. Firmly rooted in the osteopathic tradition and written in a precise and clear language honed in decades of teaching, this is nevertheless a very modern book that also references relevant scientific sources and includes links to technique videos wherever this is useful. One cannot learn techniques purely from a book. But for those who learned in practical courses to listen to the tissues and find a Point Of Balance, this book is an invaluable resource for specific approaches to the various areas of the body. --Raimund Engel, MSc., D.O. Principal of the Vienna School of Osteopathy

Probably the most important osteopathic book of recent years, written by long-time experts in the field. It is very practical and hands-on, and at the same time shows a deep understanding of physiology in osteopathic interaction. This book will be a source of inspiration not only for students, but also for osteopaths with many years of experience --Eva Möckel D.O., F.S.C.C.O., faculty member of the Sutherland Cranial College of Osteopathy",
