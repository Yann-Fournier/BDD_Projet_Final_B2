Raynor Winn,"Revue de presse
A beautiful, thoughtful, lyrical story of homelessness, human strength and endurance ― Guardian

An astonishing narrative of two people dragging themselves from the depths of despair along some of the most dramatic landscapes in the country, looking for a solution to their problems and ultimately finding themselves. ― Independent

A gem of a book ― Guardian, Best Books of Summer

This is what you need to read right now to muster hope and resilience. A beautiful story and a reminder that humans can endure adversity ― Stylist

Ray&#39s account of their incredible journey is a tale of triumph, of hope over despair ― Pick of the paperbacks, The Sunday Times

The landscape is magical, shape-shifting seas and smugglers&#39 coves; myriad sea birds and mauve skies . . . It&#39s a tale of triumph: of hope over despair; of love over everything . . . home was no longer about bricks and mortar. It was a state of mind ― The Sunday Times

An inspirational nature memoir for fans of H is for Hawk about losing everything and finding yourself between the elements of sea and sky ― Waterstones

The Salt Path is a life-affirming tale of enduring love that smells of the sea and tastes of a rich life. With beautiful, immersive writing, it is a story heart-achingly and beautifully told.

The most inspirational book of this year . . . In some ways The Salt Path reads like the ultimate drop-out odyssey, except that this journey isn&#39t a life choice . . . What the book chiefly conveys is the human capacity for endurance and the regenerative power of nature . . . The Salt Path also serves as a reminder that Britain is a land criss-crossed by footpaths and that we take this 140,000-mile national glory for granted at our peril . . . The Salt Path has reminded me to scrape last year&#39s mud from my walking boots and get rambling again. I hope it has the same impact on millions of others. ― The Times

Moving and beautifully evocative ― i

Uplifting and inspirational ― Woman & Home

An exquisite piece of writing ― Western Morning News

A fabulous read, inspiring and life-affirming. If you&#39re not already walking the coastal path, this book will make you want to set-off immediately. It is a hymn to the power of love, sear-air and the natural beauty of Cornwall to heal and nurture. It&#39s an absolute joy ― Cornwall Life

What an absolutely glorious and moving book. It deserves all its praise!

A triumph of love and hope and giving oneself up to the healing power of nature. Beautifully written with vivid imagery, what a heart-warming and glorious read

Luminescent. A literary phenomenon ― Mail on Sunday

Utterly inspirational ― The Times

The Salt Path broke my heart and put it back together again over and over. Beautiful writing, and such a sharp eye - both for nature and for people. It&#39s hopeful and sad and honest and I LOVED it.

Harnesses the wildness of rock, sky and coastal walking in life-affirming prose -- Emma Stonex ― Guardian

Radiant, soaring, heartstring-tugging ― BBC Countryfile

A remarkable account of the healing power of landscape and the resilience of the human spirit. I felt the rain on my face and heard the waves pounding on the sand.

Inspirational ― Good Housekeeping

The Salt Path pummelled me like Atlantic winds. It carried me along on a rain-soaked, sun-burnt, despair-infused, hope-driven walk. The writing is at times raw, poetic, funny, shocking. It is consistently honest, vulnerable, clear. I finished the book reminded of the importance of really hearing people&#39s stories, of the healing power of the natural world, and of our individual and collective now. ― The Ecologist

A thoughtful, lyrical story of homelessness, strength and endurance ― The Week

A moving true story ― i Paper

Beautiful, sad, erudite and uplifting ― The New European

An uplifting tale ― Cornish Times

Vivid . . .This is a book essentially about hope, but also about sheer gritty determination not to give in, to survive extreme discomfort, danger and sometimes disillusionment ― Kibworth & District Chronicle

An inspirational true story ― Top Sante

It&#39s a heart-warming, heart-wrenching story, told by Raynor in vivid yet plain prose. There are so many wonderful passages ― Church Times

Raynor&#39s writing is beautiful. It&#39s a heart-wrenching read at times, but you won&#39t be able to put it down ― Mirror

We walk with Ray and Moth every step of the way, sharing the hunger, exhaustion, blazing heat and freezing rain in an account that is both lyrical and inspirational ― Guardian, Top 10 books about walking in Britain

An extraordinary memoir - moving, funny and uplifting ― Open Up

An inspirational and lyrically observed memoir on the regenerative power of walking in nature, as well as a reminder that material things are much less important than we sometimes think. If you love the landscape of the British coastline and are drawn to the philosophies of mindfulness and minimalism, this is a moving and reflective book to read during a break from your everyday life ― Guardian

Quatrième de couverture
Just days after Raynor learns that Moth, her husband of 32 years, is terminally ill, their home is taken away and they lose their livelihood. With nothing left and little time, they make the brave and impulsive decision to walk the 630 miles of the sea-swept South West Coast Path, from Somerset to Dorset, via Devon and Cornwall.

Carrying only the essentials for survival on their backs, they live wild in the ancient, weathered landscape of cliffs, sea and sky. Yet through every step, every encounter and every test along the way, their walk becomes a remarkable journey.

The Salt Path is an honest and life-affirming true story of coming to terms with grief and the healing power of the natural world. Ultimately, it is a portrayal of home, and how it can be lost, rebuilt and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.
