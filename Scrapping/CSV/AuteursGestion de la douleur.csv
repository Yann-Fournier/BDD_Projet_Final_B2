Health Food or Health Disaster?

The greatest obstacle to discovering the shape of the earth, the continents, and the ocean was not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.  —Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers, 1985

Actor Liam Hemsworth publicly blamed spinach smoothies for a 2019 kidney stone episode that required surgery. At age 29 he had to miss a movie premiere and an awards banquet because of it. In 2020, Men’s Health magazine quoted Mr. Hemsworth as saying: “February last year, I was feeling really low and lethargic and wasn’t feeling good generally. And then I got a kidney stone.” He added: “Every morning I was having five handfuls of spinach and then almond milk, almond butter, and also some vegan protein in a smoothie. And that was what I considered super healthy. So, I had to completely rethink what I was putting into my body.”

This book invites you to do just that: Rethink your “health” food.

Even moderate, relatively common levels of oxalate in a habitual diet can fuel the customary aches and pains of life: digestive distress, inflamed joints, chronic skin issues, brain fog or mood problems, as well as health declines associated with “normal” aging. And then there are those painful kidney stones. Eighty percent of them are formed from oxalate, much of which comes from the foods we eat.

Mr. Hemsworth was one of the lucky ones. Three weeks after completing a 10-day “green smoothie cleanse” for weight loss, a New York City woman with a history of gastric bypass surgery went to the Nassau University Medical Center on Long Island, complaining of persistent nausea, weakness, and poor appetite. She was immediately put on a low-oxalate diet, but it was too late, her kidneys did not recover, and she remained dialysis-dependent.

Similar examples of kidney failure due to consumption of “health foods” include a man, also attempting to lose weight, who juiced celery, carrots, parsley, beets with their greens, and spinach. The man’s kidneys were seriously damaged. His doctors at the Mayo Clinic prescribed dialysis and a low-oxalate diet. He stopped juicing. It took more than four months for his kidney function to improve.

And it’s not just kidney failure. Damage from dietary oxalate can hit any—or every—bodily system and cause serious chronic health problems. It’s no accident that Mr. Hemsworth’s kidney stones were preceded by malaise, depression, and lethargy. However, most medical journals reporting health crises from overzealous oxalate consumption fail to mention the non-kidney problems that likely also occurred.

Because it is so easy to overeat oxalates, chances are you may already be experiencing occasional oxalate-related aches and pains somewhere in your body. Do you tend to get a stiff neck? In those of us with dietary oxalate overload, pain, knots, or stiffness in the top of the shoulders or in the upper or lower back are typical. Some people experience chronic or intermittent joint inflammation, gout, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or a more generalized stiffness, often accompanied by a lack of pep.

Or perhaps you have long-standing injuries or chronic itching, tingling, or pain that never fully resolves. Your doctors can’t help you figure out what is going on; they seem to think you’re “just fine” and should just live with life’s little miseries. If any of this rings true for you—if you don’t feel “just fine”—this book may be your golden opportunity to turn things around.

Other seemingly small things can be indicators of oxalate overload, including itchy or dry eyes, eye floaters, excessive tartar on the teeth, tooth sensitivity, sensitive or frail skin, and odd things like pressure or pain in the loins, irritable bladder, urinary tract infections, frequent urination, or cloudy urine. Liver stress from oxalate overload can aggravate chemical sensitivity. Digestive problems like indigestion, reflux, bloating, excessive belching, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome are especially common. Additional symptoms can include shortness of breath, sinus problems, yeast infections, and even cold hands and feet.

Do you ever feel especially clumsy or occasionally have poor coordination? Do you get muscle spasms or eye twitches, or have memory or word-finding difficulties, headaches, or anxiety and panic disorder? Being neurotoxic, oxalates can get in—and on—your nerves. Oxalic acid chemically bonds to calcium and other minerals and interferes with cell energy production. Relentless oxalate consumption can cause oxalate to build up inside the body without obvious symptoms and may culminate years later as “old-age problems” such as bad bones, chronic pain, and vision and hearing loss. Oxalate deposits are also associated with brain cell damage that leads to Parkinson’s disease and dementia disorders.

You don’t have to have symptoms to have a disease, and oxalate toxicity is no exception. But a wide spectrum of potential symptoms can occur in the wake of oxalate overload, and each of us will (eventually) suffer from our own unique subset of them if we persist with high-oxalate eating. To make it easier to consider your own situation, you can take the Risks, Symptoms, and Exposure Self-Quiz (in the Resources section, page 275) or look over Table 10.1, which lists body systems and oxalate-associated symptoms. Keep reading to get the interesting details.

There are several factors that increase the likelihood that your high-oxalate diet may be leading to oxalate overload and symptoms, including:

•A diet low in calcium and other minerals (dairy-free and vegan diets are two examples)

•Frequent use of gut-irritating foods, including beans, bran, whole grains, quinoa

•A history of repeated use of antibiotic or antifungal medications

•Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications (NSAIDs)

•Obesity or diabetes

•Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), leaky gut, food sensitivities, bariatric surgery, or gut dysbiosis

•Frailty or other chronic non-oxalate illness

•Poor kidney health, history of kidney stones, family history of kidney disease.

As you will see in Part 2 of the book, simply trying a low-oxalate diet for a few months is another way to assess your situation.

The Hard Road to Enlightenment

Maybe, like me, you have always considered yourself a healthy eater. It was healthy eating that led to my ill health. I was beyond exhausted—unable to read with comprehension, unable to work. A high-tech sleep study showed that I was waking up 29 times every hour. Medications did nothing to improve the situation. I was stuck, and no one could help me. I had problems with joint pain and symptoms of genital burning, but I did not connect them to my exhaustion and sleep issues. It was my genital burning that, in 2009, led me to the Vulvar Pain (VP) Foundation, and under the fog of my heavy brain fatigue I decided to try the low-oxalate diet they recommended, hoping for relief from genital pain, not understanding the potential scope of effects or the long period needed for full recovery from oxalate damage.

In my ignorance, I drifted back to my beloved sweet potatoes and celery, and in 2013, I added kiwifruit to my diet in a desperate attempt to resolve my chronic constipation. After three months of a daily kiwi (sometimes two), my arthritis and stiffness became severe (all over again). This led to the brain-twisting recognition that dietary oxalate was related to my decades of joint pain. Grudgingly, I finally got serious about maintaining a low-oxalate diet.

Once I consistently shunned my go-to high-oxalate foods (for me, mainly sweet potatoes and chard), multiple personal miracles unfolded. The debilitating sleep disorder vanished, decades of pain and joint problems receded, and I started to feel younger. I never imagined anything like that was possible. The contrast between the years of intractable problems and then dramatic, lasting, and wholly unexpected benefits in the wake of the diet change was eye-opening.
Revue de presse
“Who knew that some so-called superfoods could be the opposite of healthy? The conventional advice to eat ‘mostly plants’ is seriously challenged by the reality that plants contain known toxins. Norton makes a compelling case that oxalates are the x-factor contributing to many mysterious health conditions.”—Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise

“What if your favorite superfood was actually a supervillain? Sally Norton masterfully pinpoints the changes in our food system and eating style that have turned a common natural occurring toxin into a potential public health crisis for people who are trying their best to eat well. Her simple and effective recommendations are grounded both in modern science and the principles of ancestral health.”—Aaron Blaisdell, PhD, UCLA Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience

“As a medical profession, we have only recently begun to realize how commonly we are seeing oxalate issues be a part of the presentation of a wide variety of chronic illnesses. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been wrestling with poor health and not gotten the answers they need.”—Neil Nathan, MD, author of Toxic

“One conversation with Sally Norton transformed my health. Thankfully, she has shared her life’s work about the dangers of oxalates in this book. Everyone needs to hear her message.”—Dr. Bill Schindler, author of Eat Like a Human

“Sally Norton does a super job of revealing the many ways oxalates can promote the health of plants and undermine the health of people. This book is a must-read for people who eat plant-based superfoods.”—Fred Provenza, PhD, author of Nourishment

“An invaluable book that tells the story of the deleterious health effects of oxalate in our food.”—Miki Ben-Dor, PhD

“This book has the power to change the course of your health, happiness, and longevity for the better.”—James L. Oschman, PhD, author of Energy Medicine

“Juicing, raw food, and vegan trends have come and gone over my 30 years in the integrative oncology world and is currently all the rage again.  This trend has created an illusion of health, and yet, clinically, I have seen the opposite. Sally has done an excellent job confirming what I have been seeing clinically.”—Dr. Nasha Winters, ND, FABNO

“A revealing and riveting must-read.”—Kaayla T. Daniel, PhD, author of The Whole Soy Story and coauthor of Nourishing Broth

“[I]nformative. . . . The extensive charts showing the oxalate content of various foods make it easy to follow a low-oxalate diet. . . . [A] straightforward resource for potentially curbing a host of symptoms.”—Publishers Weekly

INTRODUCTION

This is a book about our bodies—yours and mine. We are different in height, weight, and possibly gender. But our common possession is the body&#39s inner power to heal itself and to be pain free. By choosing those two words as my title, I am celebrating our mutual good fortune. I am also making a promise that I know you can keep.

Being pain free takes personal effort and commitment. It doesn&#39t come from a pill bottle, a surgeon&#39s knife, a brace, or in specially designed mattresses, chairs, and tools. The thousands of men and women who in the course of a typical year visit my Egoscue Method Clinic in San Diego, California, know it, or they soon find out, and I watch them transform their lives as they rediscover the joy and health that had seemed lost forever. While each client is dedicated to stopping chronic pain in one form or another, they are all taking the easy way out. The easiest, really.

The following pages show you the way. It does not involve high-tech medicine or elaborate physical therapy routines. You won&#39t need to buy special equipment or consult cadres of experts. In the first three chapters, I review how the human body is designed to maintain its own health throughout a long lifetime. Episodes of pain are aberrations that can be easily treated if the body is permitted to do its work. Unfortunately, many of us don&#39t understand even the most basic features of this magnificent ""machine.""

Following this overview are eight chapters, each dealing with a specific chronic pain condition. You have probably already looked at the table of contents. I reverse the usual order and go from foot to head: sore feet, ankles, knees, hips, back, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, neck, and head. The chronic pain chapters are set up to give you a quick and thorough briefing on what&#39s happening in that part of the body when it hurts. After each briefing, I offer a series of exercises designed to alleviate the causes of pain in that body part. My friends at the clinic have nicknamed them E-cises, for ""Egoscuecises,"" to tease me for my near obsession with fine-tuning them as therapeutic tools. What started as an inside joke has taken root, and that&#39s what I call them in this book. The E-cises are arranged in menus, and are easy to do and extremely effective. To guide you along, I provide detailed instructions and many photos.

Next comes a chapter on common chronic pain problems relating to popular sports and recreational activities, and finally a concluding chapter that, among other things, offers an overall conditioning menu of E-cises for your use once your chronic pain symptoms abate.

A Quick Guide to Using Pain Free

An author probably should not presume to tell a reader how to read a book, but I will risk it anyway in the interest of making this information as accessible as possible. My guess is that you are in pain or have been in pain recently. Take the time to read the first three chapters, which give you valuable background knowledge. I&#39ll explain how a serious deficiency of ""design motion"" is causing your chronic pain symptoms and how easy it is for you to remedy the situation. Then quickly flip through the rest of the chapters to get a look at the boxes and breakouts that present key concepts in capsule form. Finally, turn to the chapter that focuses on your specific condition. My hope is that you&#39ll eventually read the book straight through, but I realize that stopping the pain may be paramount in your mind. If I had to choose one additional must-read chapter, it would be chapter 7, which deals with hips. The condition of our hips plays a central role in combating chronic pain throughout the body.

I&#39ll take one more unusual liberty as an author by making this statement: Pain Free won&#39t do you much good if you just read it. Information is fine, but action is far better. When practiced both in the clinic and at home, the E-cises in this book yield a ninety-five percent success rate. Yet the Egoscue Method conquers chronic pain only because those who are suffering are empowered with the means to heal themselves—and they use that power. Those among the five percent who are unable to find relief using the Method often do not have the time or the inclination to take action; they do the E-cises sporadically or not at all.

I urge you to use the E-cises. They look simple, but they are calibrated to pinpoint specific musculoskeletal functions that have been compromised by a variety of factors. The E-cise menus are arranged sequentially to address each component of a particular chronic pain symptom. Therefore, you should do the menu in the order it is presented; by picking and choosing E-cises at random, you risk interrupting the sequence. Likewise, if you have active pain, do not shop around in this book for something you think might work. Stick with the menu for the body part where the chronic pain is occurring. If an E-cise is specified for one side of the body, always repeat it on the other side, even though it may be harder or—as is the case many times—it doesn&#39t seem relevant to the pain symptom.

I believe in goal setting and planning. When it comes to managing one&#39s health, the old maxim ""Those who do not plan, plan to fail"" is particularly true. Even so, people who wouldn&#39t dream of doing business or providing for their families until they had a clear set of objectives and a strategy for achieving them, make major health decisions without knowing what they want, how to realize it, and what the real costs will be.

With the Egoscue Method, I ask new clients what they expect to get for their money. Is it pain relief, enhanced athletic performance, or a good night&#39s sleep? There are many legitimate answers. In turn, I tell them what we can do, how much it will cost, how long it will take, and what they will be expected to do. If I don&#39t keep my end of the bargain, the client gets his or her money back. The guarantee is in play from the very first visit. If the client is hurting and doesn&#39t feel better on leaving, the visit is free.

Does this sound like buying an appliance from a reputable dealer, or laying out the terms of an important business deal? Comparisons like that couldn&#39t please me more. Any vendor of health care, mainstream or alternative, who isn&#39t willing to stand by the product must be treated with the utmost caution. They shouldn&#39t hide behind science, expertise, or complexity. If the tough questions aren&#39t asked, shame on you, the consumer; if they&#39re not answered, shame on us, the supplier. Ducking and dodging have the same universal meaning, whether the product comes with four worn tires and suspiciously low mileage or is bristling with terminology that no layperson can understand. As a consumer, the less you know, the more you should worry that the product may not work as advertised. Many common musculoskeletal treatments don&#39t work as advertised; that&#39s why patients find it so difficult to get straight answers to their questions, starting with ""Why does it hurt?"" They often get probablies, maybes, and chances ares. Even a direct answer to a question about the cause of joint pain—cartilage loss—smothers in a blanket of vagueness when patients ask a follow-up question: ""Why is there cartilage loss on the right side and not the left?"" When it comes to health care, it is imperative to ask and keep asking the same nuts-and-bolts questions that you would ask in any straightforward consumer transaction.

In addition to being grounded solidly in this consumer-knows-best philosophy, the Egoscue Method&#39s E-cises, by suppressing pain symptoms, eliminate impulses to buy products for which patients probably have no need in the first place. If a surgical procedure or drug regimen is designed to eliminate pain, but exercise therapy has already eliminated it, why bother with the surgery or drugs? ""Because,"" you&#39re likely to be told, ""the pain will return."" That&#39s correct, it will return. But the most basic question of all is, Why should it return? The answer lies at the heart of the entire Egoscue Method. Unless treatment addresses underlying musculoskeletal dysfunctions, pain relief can be only temporary. Nobody wants to hurt, and nobody should have to. But eliminating the pain symptom is only the first step. Without going to the next one, the muscles will continue to tell the bones to move in ways that violate the body&#39s design. That&#39s why the chronic pain will return.

The only product that&#39s worth investing in is a fully functional musculoskeletal system. It&#39s no luxury but rather a basic necessity that&#39s within everyone&#39s reach.

Quatrième de couverture
A proven program that teaches you how to harness the body’s natural movement patterns in daily activities to get fit, healthy, and pain-free for life
Hunching over a keyboard, commuting long hours, slouching on the couch—poor postures resulting from our sedentary lifestyle have thrown our bodies out of balance, causing unnecessary stress and strain that compromise our joints, restrict organ function, and weaken our muscles.
Dr. Eric Goodman has spent years studying human physiology and movement. He’s helped people of all ages and occupations heal and correct lifelong debilitating pain with his revolutionary Foundation Training, a practical program that targets the posterior chain muscles—shoulders, back, butt, and legs—shifting the burden of support to where it belongs: the large muscle groups.
Foundation Training is simple: no gyms, no specialized equipment, no complicated stretches. It’s a series of powerful movements you can integrate successfully into everyday life—from playing with the kids to washing dishes to long hours in the office—transforming ordinary physical actions into active and mindful movements that help to eliminate pain, boost your energy, and strengthen your body. By harnessing the body’s natural movement patterns, you can be fit, healthy, and pain-free for good.

Alan Gordon,"Extrait
In my mid- twenties, life was good. I was in graduate school for psychotherapy at USC. I was an outgoing, active guy. I hung out with my friends. I went to Dodgers games. I was in a kick­ball league (my team even made it to Nationals!). But during my second year of grad school, everything changed. I devel­oped severe lower back pain, and it completely derailed my life.

Even something as simple as sitting through a movie became a two- hour- long nightmare. Dodgers games were out of the question. I couldn’t watch sports, let alone play them. The stiff classroom seats at USC caused me so much pain, I had to buy a soft, lean- back chair from Office Depot and roll it from class to class. In case you’re wondering, lugging a giant chair every­where you go is not great for your social life.

I saw three of the leading back specialists in Los Angeles. One of them told me that my pain was caused by a disc her­niation. One of them told me that my symptoms were due to disc degeneration. One of them told me that my back hurt be­cause I was just too tall.

I couldn’t make myself shorter, but I tried every other treat­ment imaginable: physical therapy, biofeedback, acupuncture, acupressure. Nothing helped. I got so many MRI scans of my back, my friends joked that my spine was turning into a magnet.

After about six months, I got an epidural injection. It didn’t cure me, but it cut my pain in half. Life was once again bearable . . . for about eight days. Until one morning, out of nowhere, I felt like a grenade went off in my head. It was the most excruciating headache I’d ever had.

And it stayed.

Chronic daily headache, the internet told me, had no known cause and no known cure. Terrific.

After seeing even more doctors, I found a headache special­ist who diagnosed me with high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. He prescribed some medication, which didn’t help.

Here’s the thing about high- CSF- pressure headaches: the pain is worse when you lie down. So I couldn’t sit up because it hurt my back, and I couldn’t lie down because it hurt my head. My father, practical man that he is, suggested that I try to find a way to live at a forty- five- degree angle. Thanks, Dad.

Over the next several years, I developed the following addi­tional symptoms:
•upper back pain
•neck pain
•shoulder pain
•knee pain
•heel pain
•tongue pain (who gets tongue pain?)
•eye pain
•tooth pain
•toe pain (three different toes!)
•hip pain
•stomach pain
•wrist pain
•foot pain
•leg pain
•TMJ
•heartburn
•vertigo
•tinnitus
•itching
•fatigue
 
In short, I was a mess. Doctors were scared of me. I had plenty of diagnoses to go along with these symptoms: bulging discs, partially torn rotator cuff, repetitive strain injury, etc. But none of the medical treatments helped me.

Pain took over my life. It was too hard to put on a happy face with my friends, so I withdrew socially. I couldn’t work. I put my life completely on hold to try to deal with my pain. I even moved back home with my parents.

One day my mom gave me a book about a mind- body ap­proach to treating pain. She told me that her friend’s son had read it, and it had helped him get rid of his back pain. She’s a loving mother, and she was trying to help me. So I did what any rational chronic pain sufferer would do. I threw the book across the room.
“A book isn’t going to help me, Mom. The pain isn’t in my head. I have a bunch of diagnoses from doctors.”

She shrugged and left the room. You don’t argue with some­one in chronic pain.
A year later I finally read the book, and I spoke with my mom’s friend’s son. The book didn’t get rid of my pain, but it opened my mind to the possibility that I could. It was an im­portant first step. I decided to learn everything there is to know about pain.
 
I studied the neuroscience of pain. I learned that pain involves both the body and the brain. Normally, the brain gets signals from throughout the body and processes them. If the body ex­periences an injury, the brain generates the feeling of pain.
But sometimes the system goes haywire. Sometimes the “pain switch” in our brains can get stuck in the on position and cause chronic pain.

We call this neuroplastic pain. Normal pain is caused by damage to the body. But pain that persists after an injury has healed, or pain that has no clear physical cause, is usually neuroplastic pain. In chapter 2, I’ll explain why neuroplastic pain develops and how to determine if you have it.

I realized that I was suffering from neuroplastic pain. I’d been focused on fixing my body, but to get rid of my pain, I needed to target my brain. The mind- body approach to chronic pain was relatively new, and the treatments were underdevel­oped. So I created new techniques to rewire my brain and re­store the natural order.

I still have bulging discs. I still have high cerebrospinal fluid pressure. I probably still have a partially torn rotator cuff. But I don’t have any pain. I eliminated all twenty- two of my symptoms.

Along the way, I realized that I wasn’t alone. In fact, we’re in the midst of a chronic pain epidemic. More than 50 million adults suffer from chronic pain in the United States alone. Globally, the number is estimated to be 1.2 billion!

Treating chronic pain became my life’s work. I founded the Pain Psychology Center and began helping other sufferers. In my experience, the majority of chronic pain is neuroplastic pain. Over the years, we’ve refined our techniques into a con­sistently effective system— Pain Reprocessing Therapy— and we’ve helped people overcome every form of pain imaginable.
