Health Food or Health Disaster?

The greatest obstacle to discovering the shape of the earth, the continents, and the ocean was not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.  —Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers, 1985

Actor Liam Hemsworth publicly blamed spinach smoothies for a 2019 kidney stone episode that required surgery. At age 29 he had to miss a movie premiere and an awards banquet because of it. In 2020, Men’s Health magazine quoted Mr. Hemsworth as saying: “February last year, I was feeling really low and lethargic and wasn’t feeling good generally. And then I got a kidney stone.” He added: “Every morning I was having five handfuls of spinach and then almond milk, almond butter, and also some vegan protein in a smoothie. And that was what I considered super healthy. So, I had to completely rethink what I was putting into my body.”

This book invites you to do just that: Rethink your “health” food.

Even moderate, relatively common levels of oxalate in a habitual diet can fuel the customary aches and pains of life: digestive distress, inflamed joints, chronic skin issues, brain fog or mood problems, as well as health declines associated with “normal” aging. And then there are those painful kidney stones. Eighty percent of them are formed from oxalate, much of which comes from the foods we eat.

Mr. Hemsworth was one of the lucky ones. Three weeks after completing a 10-day “green smoothie cleanse” for weight loss, a New York City woman with a history of gastric bypass surgery went to the Nassau University Medical Center on Long Island, complaining of persistent nausea, weakness, and poor appetite. She was immediately put on a low-oxalate diet, but it was too late, her kidneys did not recover, and she remained dialysis-dependent.

Similar examples of kidney failure due to consumption of “health foods” include a man, also attempting to lose weight, who juiced celery, carrots, parsley, beets with their greens, and spinach. The man’s kidneys were seriously damaged. His doctors at the Mayo Clinic prescribed dialysis and a low-oxalate diet. He stopped juicing. It took more than four months for his kidney function to improve.

And it’s not just kidney failure. Damage from dietary oxalate can hit any—or every—bodily system and cause serious chronic health problems. It’s no accident that Mr. Hemsworth’s kidney stones were preceded by malaise, depression, and lethargy. However, most medical journals reporting health crises from overzealous oxalate consumption fail to mention the non-kidney problems that likely also occurred.

Because it is so easy to overeat oxalates, chances are you may already be experiencing occasional oxalate-related aches and pains somewhere in your body. Do you tend to get a stiff neck? In those of us with dietary oxalate overload, pain, knots, or stiffness in the top of the shoulders or in the upper or lower back are typical. Some people experience chronic or intermittent joint inflammation, gout, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or a more generalized stiffness, often accompanied by a lack of pep.

Or perhaps you have long-standing injuries or chronic itching, tingling, or pain that never fully resolves. Your doctors can’t help you figure out what is going on; they seem to think you’re “just fine” and should just live with life’s little miseries. If any of this rings true for you—if you don’t feel “just fine”—this book may be your golden opportunity to turn things around.

Other seemingly small things can be indicators of oxalate overload, including itchy or dry eyes, eye floaters, excessive tartar on the teeth, tooth sensitivity, sensitive or frail skin, and odd things like pressure or pain in the loins, irritable bladder, urinary tract infections, frequent urination, or cloudy urine. Liver stress from oxalate overload can aggravate chemical sensitivity. Digestive problems like indigestion, reflux, bloating, excessive belching, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome are especially common. Additional symptoms can include shortness of breath, sinus problems, yeast infections, and even cold hands and feet.

Do you ever feel especially clumsy or occasionally have poor coordination? Do you get muscle spasms or eye twitches, or have memory or word-finding difficulties, headaches, or anxiety and panic disorder? Being neurotoxic, oxalates can get in—and on—your nerves. Oxalic acid chemically bonds to calcium and other minerals and interferes with cell energy production. Relentless oxalate consumption can cause oxalate to build up inside the body without obvious symptoms and may culminate years later as “old-age problems” such as bad bones, chronic pain, and vision and hearing loss. Oxalate deposits are also associated with brain cell damage that leads to Parkinson’s disease and dementia disorders.

You don’t have to have symptoms to have a disease, and oxalate toxicity is no exception. But a wide spectrum of potential symptoms can occur in the wake of oxalate overload, and each of us will (eventually) suffer from our own unique subset of them if we persist with high-oxalate eating. To make it easier to consider your own situation, you can take the Risks, Symptoms, and Exposure Self-Quiz (in the Resources section, page 275) or look over Table 10.1, which lists body systems and oxalate-associated symptoms. Keep reading to get the interesting details.

There are several factors that increase the likelihood that your high-oxalate diet may be leading to oxalate overload and symptoms, including:

•A diet low in calcium and other minerals (dairy-free and vegan diets are two examples)

•Frequent use of gut-irritating foods, including beans, bran, whole grains, quinoa

•A history of repeated use of antibiotic or antifungal medications

•Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications (NSAIDs)

•Obesity or diabetes

•Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), leaky gut, food sensitivities, bariatric surgery, or gut dysbiosis

•Frailty or other chronic non-oxalate illness

•Poor kidney health, history of kidney stones, family history of kidney disease.

As you will see in Part 2 of the book, simply trying a low-oxalate diet for a few months is another way to assess your situation.

The Hard Road to Enlightenment

Maybe, like me, you have always considered yourself a healthy eater. It was healthy eating that led to my ill health. I was beyond exhausted—unable to read with comprehension, unable to work. A high-tech sleep study showed that I was waking up 29 times every hour. Medications did nothing to improve the situation. I was stuck, and no one could help me. I had problems with joint pain and symptoms of genital burning, but I did not connect them to my exhaustion and sleep issues. It was my genital burning that, in 2009, led me to the Vulvar Pain (VP) Foundation, and under the fog of my heavy brain fatigue I decided to try the low-oxalate diet they recommended, hoping for relief from genital pain, not understanding the potential scope of effects or the long period needed for full recovery from oxalate damage.

In my ignorance, I drifted back to my beloved sweet potatoes and celery, and in 2013, I added kiwifruit to my diet in a desperate attempt to resolve my chronic constipation. After three months of a daily kiwi (sometimes two), my arthritis and stiffness became severe (all over again). This led to the brain-twisting recognition that dietary oxalate was related to my decades of joint pain. Grudgingly, I finally got serious about maintaining a low-oxalate diet.

Once I consistently shunned my go-to high-oxalate foods (for me, mainly sweet potatoes and chard), multiple personal miracles unfolded. The debilitating sleep disorder vanished, decades of pain and joint problems receded, and I started to feel younger. I never imagined anything like that was possible. The contrast between the years of intractable problems and then dramatic, lasting, and wholly unexpected benefits in the wake of the diet change was eye-opening.
Revue de presse
“Who knew that some so-called superfoods could be the opposite of healthy? The conventional advice to eat ‘mostly plants’ is seriously challenged by the reality that plants contain known toxins. Norton makes a compelling case that oxalates are the x-factor contributing to many mysterious health conditions.”—Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise

“What if your favorite superfood was actually a supervillain? Sally Norton masterfully pinpoints the changes in our food system and eating style that have turned a common natural occurring toxin into a potential public health crisis for people who are trying their best to eat well. Her simple and effective recommendations are grounded both in modern science and the principles of ancestral health.”—Aaron Blaisdell, PhD, UCLA Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience

“As a medical profession, we have only recently begun to realize how commonly we are seeing oxalate issues be a part of the presentation of a wide variety of chronic illnesses. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been wrestling with poor health and not gotten the answers they need.”—Neil Nathan, MD, author of Toxic

“One conversation with Sally Norton transformed my health. Thankfully, she has shared her life’s work about the dangers of oxalates in this book. Everyone needs to hear her message.”—Dr. Bill Schindler, author of Eat Like a Human

“Sally Norton does a super job of revealing the many ways oxalates can promote the health of plants and undermine the health of people. This book is a must-read for people who eat plant-based superfoods.”—Fred Provenza, PhD, author of Nourishment

“An invaluable book that tells the story of the deleterious health effects of oxalate in our food.”—Miki Ben-Dor, PhD

“This book has the power to change the course of your health, happiness, and longevity for the better.”—James L. Oschman, PhD, author of Energy Medicine

“Juicing, raw food, and vegan trends have come and gone over my 30 years in the integrative oncology world and is currently all the rage again.  This trend has created an illusion of health, and yet, clinically, I have seen the opposite. Sally has done an excellent job confirming what I have been seeing clinically.”—Dr. Nasha Winters, ND, FABNO

“A revealing and riveting must-read.”—Kaayla T. Daniel, PhD, author of The Whole Soy Story and coauthor of Nourishing Broth

“[I]nformative. . . . The extensive charts showing the oxalate content of various foods make it easy to follow a low-oxalate diet. . . . [A] straightforward resource for potentially curbing a host of symptoms.”—Publishers Weekly

Quatrième de couverture
A proven program that teaches you how to harness the body’s natural movement patterns in daily activities to get fit, healthy, and pain-free for life
Hunching over a keyboard, commuting long hours, slouching on the couch—poor postures resulting from our sedentary lifestyle have thrown our bodies out of balance, causing unnecessary stress and strain that compromise our joints, restrict organ function, and weaken our muscles.
Dr. Eric Goodman has spent years studying human physiology and movement. He’s helped people of all ages and occupations heal and correct lifelong debilitating pain with his revolutionary Foundation Training, a practical program that targets the posterior chain muscles—shoulders, back, butt, and legs—shifting the burden of support to where it belongs: the large muscle groups.
Foundation Training is simple: no gyms, no specialized equipment, no complicated stretches. It’s a series of powerful movements you can integrate successfully into everyday life—from playing with the kids to washing dishes to long hours in the office—transforming ordinary physical actions into active and mindful movements that help to eliminate pain, boost your energy, and strengthen your body. By harnessing the body’s natural movement patterns, you can be fit, healthy, and pain-free for good.

Alan Gordon,"Extrait
In my mid- twenties, life was good. I was in graduate school for psychotherapy at USC. I was an outgoing, active guy. I hung out with my friends. I went to Dodgers games. I was in a kick­ball league (my team even made it to Nationals!). But during my second year of grad school, everything changed. I devel­oped severe lower back pain, and it completely derailed my life.

Even something as simple as sitting through a movie became a two- hour- long nightmare. Dodgers games were out of the question. I couldn’t watch sports, let alone play them. The stiff classroom seats at USC caused me so much pain, I had to buy a soft, lean- back chair from Office Depot and roll it from class to class. In case you’re wondering, lugging a giant chair every­where you go is not great for your social life.

I saw three of the leading back specialists in Los Angeles. One of them told me that my pain was caused by a disc her­niation. One of them told me that my symptoms were due to disc degeneration. One of them told me that my back hurt be­cause I was just too tall.

I couldn’t make myself shorter, but I tried every other treat­ment imaginable: physical therapy, biofeedback, acupuncture, acupressure. Nothing helped. I got so many MRI scans of my back, my friends joked that my spine was turning into a magnet.

After about six months, I got an epidural injection. It didn’t cure me, but it cut my pain in half. Life was once again bearable . . . for about eight days. Until one morning, out of nowhere, I felt like a grenade went off in my head. It was the most excruciating headache I’d ever had.

And it stayed.

Chronic daily headache, the internet told me, had no known cause and no known cure. Terrific.

After seeing even more doctors, I found a headache special­ist who diagnosed me with high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. He prescribed some medication, which didn’t help.

Here’s the thing about high- CSF- pressure headaches: the pain is worse when you lie down. So I couldn’t sit up because it hurt my back, and I couldn’t lie down because it hurt my head. My father, practical man that he is, suggested that I try to find a way to live at a forty- five- degree angle. Thanks, Dad.

Over the next several years, I developed the following addi­tional symptoms:
•upper back pain
•neck pain
•shoulder pain
•knee pain
•heel pain
•tongue pain (who gets tongue pain?)
•eye pain
•tooth pain
•toe pain (three different toes!)
•hip pain
•stomach pain
•wrist pain
•foot pain
•leg pain
•TMJ
•heartburn
•vertigo
•tinnitus
•itching
•fatigue
 
In short, I was a mess. Doctors were scared of me. I had plenty of diagnoses to go along with these symptoms: bulging discs, partially torn rotator cuff, repetitive strain injury, etc. But none of the medical treatments helped me.

Pain took over my life. It was too hard to put on a happy face with my friends, so I withdrew socially. I couldn’t work. I put my life completely on hold to try to deal with my pain. I even moved back home with my parents.

One day my mom gave me a book about a mind- body ap­proach to treating pain. She told me that her friend’s son had read it, and it had helped him get rid of his back pain. She’s a loving mother, and she was trying to help me. So I did what any rational chronic pain sufferer would do. I threw the book across the room.
“A book isn’t going to help me, Mom. The pain isn’t in my head. I have a bunch of diagnoses from doctors.”

She shrugged and left the room. You don’t argue with some­one in chronic pain.
A year later I finally read the book, and I spoke with my mom’s friend’s son. The book didn’t get rid of my pain, but it opened my mind to the possibility that I could. It was an im­portant first step. I decided to learn everything there is to know about pain.
 
I studied the neuroscience of pain. I learned that pain involves both the body and the brain. Normally, the brain gets signals from throughout the body and processes them. If the body ex­periences an injury, the brain generates the feeling of pain.
But sometimes the system goes haywire. Sometimes the “pain switch” in our brains can get stuck in the on position and cause chronic pain.

We call this neuroplastic pain. Normal pain is caused by damage to the body. But pain that persists after an injury has healed, or pain that has no clear physical cause, is usually neuroplastic pain. In chapter 2, I’ll explain why neuroplastic pain develops and how to determine if you have it.

I realized that I was suffering from neuroplastic pain. I’d been focused on fixing my body, but to get rid of my pain, I needed to target my brain. The mind- body approach to chronic pain was relatively new, and the treatments were underdevel­oped. So I created new techniques to rewire my brain and re­store the natural order.

I still have bulging discs. I still have high cerebrospinal fluid pressure. I probably still have a partially torn rotator cuff. But I don’t have any pain. I eliminated all twenty- two of my symptoms.

Along the way, I realized that I wasn’t alone. In fact, we’re in the midst of a chronic pain epidemic. More than 50 million adults suffer from chronic pain in the United States alone. Globally, the number is estimated to be 1.2 billion!

Treating chronic pain became my life’s work. I founded the Pain Psychology Center and began helping other sufferers. In my experience, the majority of chronic pain is neuroplastic pain. Over the years, we’ve refined our techniques into a con­sistently effective system— Pain Reprocessing Therapy— and we’ve helped people overcome every form of pain imaginable.

The Way Out provides a scientifically valid approach for treating (and often curing) chronic pain. In addition to being a useful book, it is an easy and enjoyable read. Alan and Alon effectively use patient examples to explain and illustrate the techniques. Every person who suffers with chronic pain will find comfort and healing in the pages of The Way Out. Every clinician who treats chronic pain should read The Way Out, they will become a wiser and better guide for their patients.”
–Steven Richeimer, MD, Chief of Pain Medicine, USC Keck School of Medicine
 
“The Way Out offers a wonderfully clear and compelling combination of personal experience and the latest breakthroughs in brain science to show how to reduce chronic pain. Beautifully written, with gentle humor and genuine compassion, the authors start from acknowledging the reality of chronic pain and invite you to try techniques that promise a new freedom that might have seemed impossible – a transformation that will affect both you and those with whom you share your life.”
–Mark Williams, emeritus professor of clinical psychology, University of Oxford, coauthor of Mindfulness
 
""If you suffer from chronic pain (or know someone who does), The Way Out is an optimistic, science-based book about managing the mind-body connection to healing. Alan Gordon writes with compassion, empathy, and a deep understanding of living with pain. Finding relief from his own suffering prompted him to find freedom for others.”
–Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness and Real Change
 
“Quite possibly the most important pain book ever written. The Way Out will be the answer for millions who live in constant agony. There is healing without drugs or dangerous surgeries, and The Way Out is the book to help you finally find healing. As a former chronic pain sufferer, I know firsthand how every area of your life will improve when you are finally out of constant pain. Read this book, you deserve it.”
–Annie Grace, author of This Naked Mind
 
“The Way Out highlights the role of neuroplasticity in chronic pain and explores how to tackle it. This is a great positive step forward in chronic pain treatment.""
–Clifford Woolf, MD, professor of neurology and neurobiology, Harvard Medical School
 
“A compelling journey and fascinating read. In The Way Out, Gordon and Ziv bring together serendipity and science, demonstrating the power of the mind, and how we all can harness our own brains for healing.”
–Judson Brewer, MD, PhD, New York Times bestselling author of Unwinding Anxiety and The Craving Mind
 
“The strain in pain lies mainly in the brain.  This accessible, warm book is a re-minder of how you can learn to better control pain by learning to think differently about it.”
–David Spiegel, MD, Willson Professor and Associate Chair of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, coauthor of Trance and Treatment

“It’s long been assumed that chronic pain is irreversible, but The Way Out introduces an approach that proves otherwise. I have seen the power of this treatment firsthand. Patients who suffered for years or even decades have made remarkable recoveries. The Way Out is quite simply the most effective treatment for chronic pain.”
–Howard Schubiner, MD, founder and director of the Mind-Body Medicine Program, Ascension Providence Hospital
