Renilde Loeckx,"The extraordinary story of scientists in East and West combatting HIV
A small group of scientists were doggedly working in the field of antiviral treatments when the AIDS epidemic struck. Faced with one of the grand challenges of modern biology of the twentieth century, scientists worked across the political divide of the Cold War to produce a new class of antivirals. Their molecules were developed by a Californian start-up together with teams of scientists at the Rega Institute of KU Leuven and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (IOCB) of the Academy of Sciences in Prague. These molecules became the cornerstone of the blockbuster drugs now used to combat and prevent HIV. Cold War Triangle gives an insight into the human face of science as it recounts the extraordinary story of scientists in East and West who overcame ideological barriers and worked together for the benefit of humanity.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fVFRztHVL._SY600_.jpg

Quatrième de couverture
Magnificently reported and soulfully crafted, An Elegant Defense is an epic, first-of-its-kind exploration of the human immune system and the secrets of health, by Pulitzer Prize–winning New York Times journalist Matt Richtel
A terminal cancer patient rises from the grave. A medical marvel defies HIV. Two women with autoimmunity discover their own bodies have turned against them. An Elegant Defense uniquely entwines these intimate stories with science’s centuries-long quest to unlock the mysteries of sickness and health, and illuminates the immune system as never before.
The immune system is our body’s essential defense network, a guardian vigilantly fighting illness, healing wounds, maintaining order and balance, and keeping us alive. Its legion of microscopic foot soldiers—from T cells to “natural killers”—patrols our body, linked by a nearly instantaneous communications grid. It has been honed by evolution over millennia to face an almost infinite array of threats. 
For all its astonishing complexity, however, the immune system can be easily compromised by fatigue, stress, toxins, advanced age, and poor nutrition—hallmarks of modern life—and even by excessive hygiene. Paradoxically, it is a fragile wonder weapon that can turn on our own bodies with startling results, leading today to epidemic levels of autoimmune disorders.
Richtel effortlessly guides readers on a scientific detective tale winding from the Black Plague to twentieth-century breakthroughs in vaccination and antibiotics, to the cutting-edge laboratories that are revolutionizing immunology—perhaps the most extraordinary and consequential medical story of our time. The foundation that Richtel builds makes accessible revelations about cancer immunotherapy, the microbiome, and autoimmune treatments that are changing millions of lives. An Elegant Defense also captures in vivid detail how these powerful therapies, along with our behavior and environment, interact with the immune system, often for the good but always on a razor’s edge that can throw this remarkable system out of balance.
Drawing on his groundbreaking reporting for the New York Times and based on extensive new interviews with dozens of world-renowned scientists, Matt Richtel has produced a landmark book, equally an investigation into the deepest riddles of survival and a profoundly human tale that is movingly brought to life through the eyes of his four main characters, each of whom illuminates an essential facet of our “elegant defense.”

Philipp Dettmer,"Revue de presse
&#39Through wonderful analogies and a genius for clarifying complex ideas, Immune is a truly brilliant introduction to the human body&#39s vast system for fighting infections and other threats. With his trademark wit and intellectual deft, Dettmer helps us understand not just the beautiful and strange mechanics of human immune responses, but also what works (and perhaps more importantly what doesn&#39t work!) when seeking to bolster immunity.&#39 -- John Green

&#39Immune reads as if it&#39s a riveting sci-fi novel, as Philipp Dettmer takes you on a journey into the body for an up-close look at the armies of expert warriors, rogue gladiators, and stealthy detectives that protect you in the daily war against trillions of ruthless microbe enemies. By the end of the book, I understood my entire body far better than I ever had before. Immune is a delightful treat for the curious&#39 -- Tim Urban
Quatrième de couverture
You wake up and feel a tickle in your throat. Your head hurts. You&#39re mildly annoyed as you get the kids ready for school and dress for work yourself. Meanwhile, an utterly epic war is being fought, just below your skin. Millions are fighting and dying for you to be able to complain as you drink your cup of tea and head out the door.

So what, exactly, IS your immune system?

Second only to the human brain in its complexity, it is one of the oldest and most critical facets of life on Earth. Without it, you would die within days. In Immune, Philipp Dettmer, the brains behind the most popular science channel on YouTube, takes readers on a journey through the fortress of the human body and its defences. There is a constant battle of staggering scale raging within us, full of stories of invasion, strategy, defeat, and noble self-sacrifice. In fact, in the time you&#39ve been reading this, your immune system has probably identified and eradicated a cancer cell that started to grow in your body.

Each chapter delves deeply into an element of the immune system, including defences like antibodies and inflammation as well as threats like viruses, bacteria, allergies and cancer, as Dettmer reveals why boosting your immune system is actually nonsense, how parasites sneak their way past your body&#39s defences, how viruses - including the coronavirus - work, and what goes on in your wounds when you cut yourself.

Enlivened by engaging full-colour graphics and immersive descriptions, Immune turns one of the most intricate, interconnected, and confusing subjects - immunology - into a gripping adventure through an astonishing alien landscape.

Challenging what you know and think about your own body and how it defends you against all sorts of maladies and how it might also eventually be your own downfall, Immune is a vital and remarkably fun crash course in what is arguably, and increasingly, the most important system in the body.

Kris Newby,"Revue de presse
Full of fascinating and sometimes-disturbing information, little of which is widely known. — Kirkus Reviews (starred review)
Quatrième de couverture
While vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard, Kris Newby was bitten by an unseen tick. That one bite changed her life forever, pulling her into the abyss of a devastating illness that took ten doctors to diagnose and years to recover from: Newby had joined the ranks of the 400,000 Americans who are afflicted with Lyme disease each year.
As a science writer, she was driven to understand why this disease is so misunderstood and its patients so mistreated. This quest led her to Willy Burgdorfer, the Lyme microbe’s discoverer, who revealed that he had developed bug-borne bioweapons during the Cold War and believed that the Lyme epidemic was started by a military experiment gone wrong.
In a superb, meticulous work of narrative journalism, Bitten takes readers on a journey to investigate these claims—from tours of biological weapons facilities to interviews with biosecurity experts and microbiologists doing cutting-edge research—all the while uncovering darker truths about Burgdorfer. It also leads Newby to uncomfortable questions about why Lyme can be so difficult to both diagnose and treat, and why the government is so reluctant to classify chronic Lyme as a disease.
A gripping, infectious page-turner, Bitten will shed a terrifying new light on an epidemic that is exacting an incalculable toll on us, upending much of what we believe we know about it.

Jonathan Kennedy,"Revue de presse
This sweeping history is Kennedy&#39s debut, and a powerfully argued one... Pathogenesis sets out, like Yuval Noah Harari&#39s Sapiens or Peter Frankopan&#39s recent The Earth Transformed, to reinterpret the entire history of mankind... A fascinating and pacey run through the history of humanity from an unfamiliar perspective. -- Book of the Week ― Sunday Times

This book challenges some of the greatest cliches about colonialism and leaves you wondering why you ever gave them the time of day. A revelation, and also that rarest thing, a science title that is entirely comprehensible and often a pleasure to read. -- Sathnam Sanghera, bestselling author of Empireland

Pathogenesis is superbly written. Kennedy seamlessly weaves together scientific and historical research, and his confident authorial voice is sure to please readers of Yuval Noah Harari or Rutger Bregman. -- David Robson ― The Times

Thrilling and eye-opening. From neolithic diseases to Covid-19, Jonathan Kennedy explores the enormous role played by some of the tiniest life on Earth: the power of plagues in shaping world history. -- Professor Lewis Dartnell, bestselling author of Origins and Being Human

From the fall of Rome to the Spanish conquest of the Americas to the industrial revolution, germs have played as much a role in history as guns, generals and ""great men""... Jonathan Kennedy restores the microbes of infectious disease to their rightful place in the story of human evolution and the rise and fall of civilisations. Science and history at its best. -- Dr Mark Honigsbaum, author of The Pandemic Century

Kennedy&#39s book, which aims to show how infectious disease has shaped us from the time of the Neanderthals to the era of Covid-19, is full of amazing facts... Pathogenesis doesn&#39t only cover thousands of years of history - it seeks radically to alter the way the reader views many of the (often very well-known) events it describes. -- Rachel Cooke ― Observer

Professor Kennedy-drawing on the latest research in fields ranging from genetics and anthropology to archaeology and economics-explores eight major outbreaks of infectious disease across the entire history of civilization... It&#39s not often you pick up a book that promises to alter your entire understanding of the story of humanity. ― LitHub

An absorbing book... Kennedy&#39s intertwined story of humanity and humongous disease is told lucidly and knowledgeably, with ample historical context. ― Telegraph

How a virus might have written human history. This is a fascinating, readable, and superbly researched account of how infectious diseases have shaped our history, from the Palaeolithic Era to Covid. -- Professor David Christian, bestselling author of Origin Story and Future Stories

Our very existence and success as a species, Kennedy argues in this fascinating book, has been shaped by bacteria and viruses. -- Book of the Day ― Guardian

I love this surprising, learned, fascinating book which brings human arrogance into sharp relief, reminding us that the real masters of the universe are microbes. Jonathan Kennedy travels through history, unpicking everything we thought we knew; we are but the pawns and playthings of viruses and bacteria. Mind-blowing. -- Cal Flyn, bestselling author of Islands of Abandonment

Well-timed ... compelling ... hopeful ... Yes, our trajectory is defined by microbes. But it&#39s also influenced by our reactions to them - and our acknowledgment of their power. ― The Atlantic

A compelling account of the role of bacteria and viruses in world history. Dr Kennedy marshals a dizzying range of material, from the transition from feudalism to capitalism in Europe to the rise of the slave trade to the defeat of the British army by American revolutionaries in Yorktown in 1781... an entertaining read. ― Economist

New and timely... His book is full of surprises... At this moment of reckoning over humankind&#39s planetary footprint, Pathogenesis offers a humbling reminder that history is made not by the great and the good, but those who survive. ― New Scientist

What has shaped the world? Not gods, not heroes, not even conquistadors, but germs... fascinating... We must collaborate... It&#39s up to us. ― New Statesman

Jonathan Kennedy’s excellent book details how germs have been laying waste to varied civilisations since Homo sapiens became dominant some 50,000 years ago... Kennedy has a fluent and engaging style. He showcases his interdisciplinary training over 300 pages that take in vast swathes of history. ― The Critic

Kennedy is right to state that pandemics and plague outbreaks have had a big influence throughout human history. Such dramatic episodes get written up by historians, and Kennedy describes their accounts with verve. ― Nature

Gripping . . . [Kennedy] wrangles an astonishing breadth of material into easily accessible, plain prose. . . . Even readers familiar with the material will find [Pathogenesis] fascinating. . . . Kennedy will leave readers galvanized by the time they flip to the last page, having assured us that we could win the narrative back from germs - if we&#39re able to muster the political will to do so. ― Washington Post

it&#39s refreshing to see a first-time writer take aim at what he sees as the failings of two of the best-read popular history titles of the past 30 years... The book shines when it brings cutting-edge science to bear... something that Kennedy treats with great care... germs feel powerfully alive and at work in history... Pathogenesis shows a microbial world that is as complex, dynamic, and alive as the human one, and just as consequential. ― Financial Times

Three hundred-odd pages roam through 50,000 years, and by the last it&#39s almost impossible to disagree that infectious diseases are our permanent companion and ultimate adversary... The fluency of Kennedy&#39s narration is remarkable, weaving Tolkien, Game of Thrones and Monty Python into memorable and accessible explanations of genetics, evolutionary biology and demography... Pathogenesis is a humbling story for humankind. -- Kate Womersley ― Spectator

In this revelatory book, Dr Jonathan Kennedy argues that germs have shaped humanity at every stage, from the first success of Homo sapiens over the equally intelligent Neanderthals to the fall of Rome and the rise of Islam.

How did an Indonesian volcano help cause the Black Death, setting Europe on the road to capitalism? How could 168 men extract the largest ransom in history from an opposing army of eighty thousand? And why did the Industrial Revolution lead to the birth of the modern welfare state?

The latest science reveals that infectious diseases are not just something that happens to us, but a fundamental part of who we are. Indeed, the only reason humans don&#39t lay eggs is that a virus long ago inserted itself into our DNA, and there are as many bacteria in your body as there are human cells. We have been thinking about the survival of the fittest all wrong: evolution is not simply about human strength and intelligence, but about how we live and thrive in a world dominated by microbes.

By exploring the startling intimacy of our relationship with infectious diseases, Kennedy shows how they have been responsible for some of the seismic revolutions of the past 50,000 years. Provocative and brimming with insight, Pathogenesis transforms our understanding of the human story, revealing how the crisis of a pandemic can offer vital opportunities for change.

PUBLISHER’S NOTE
 
Complex scientific and moral problems are not resolved through censorship of dissenting opinions, deleting content from the Internet, or defaming scientists and authors who present information challenging to those in power. Censorship leads instead to greater distrust of both government institutions and large corporations.
            There is no ideology or politics in pointing out the obvious: scientific errors and public policy errors do occur—and can have devastating consequences. Errors might result from flawed analysis, haste, arrogance, and sometimes, corruption. Whatever the cause, the solutions come from open-minded exploration, introspection, and constant review.
            Ideally, science and public policy are never static. They are a process, a collaboration, a debate and a partnership. If powerful people challenged by this book claim it contains misinformation, our response is simply this: Tell us where you believe some-thing is incorrect, make your best arguments, and offer the best available support for those arguments. We encourage and invite dialogue, criticism, engagement—and every suggestion will be heard and considered.
            Since The Wuhan Cover-up is being published in the middle of rapidly unfolding events, and since censorship and suppression of information is underway, it’s best to approach this book as a living document. When new information emerges that can add to or improve the thousands of references and citations in this book, updates, additional notes, and new references will be provided via the QR code below, and the QR codes that appear throughout the book.
            We’ve published authors with views on all sides of many controversies. That’s what we do, because at its best, publishing is a town square that lets everyone be heard—and lets everyone else listen, if they choose to. As Alan Dershowitz says, “I always learn when I read or hear Bobby’s take.” I can go several steps further, knowing from my inside view how principled and careful Bobby is as an author—and how painstakingly this book was researched.
            We look forward to taking this important journey with you.
  Revue de presse
“RFK Jr. has done it again. The Wuhan Cover-Up is not only an indispensable history of the rise of the global threat of bioweaponry, it is also an oh-so-timely deep dive into how a viral pandemic was unleashed upon the world via the deceit, greed, and foolishness of bad actors at the highest levels of our own government. A stunning sequel to The Real Anthony Fauci, and an historic publication that answers the core national security—and existential—questions of our time.”
—Naomi Wolf, bestselling author of The Beauty Myth and The Bodies of Others
 
“This’ll scare the hell out of you. The scariest part is it’s true. Thank God for Bobby Kennedy Jr.”
—Tucker Carlson
 
“The Wuhan Cover-Up will blow out of the water the international disinformation campaign by US and Chinese government officials and their bribed scientists that COVID-19 somehow magically jumped out of the Wuhan wet market. Kennedy’s book will provide the ammunition needed for us lawyers to hold them all legally accountable for this Nuremberg Crime against Humanity.”
—Professor Francis A. Boyle, author of the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989
 
“Bioweapons are a forbidden fruit but an irresistible one because the criminal is rarely identified. Were coronavirus weapons so seductive that they blurred the line between friend and enemy? Bobby Kennedy lays out the facts in a book you won&#39t put down.”
—Meryl Nass, MD, biological warfare epidemiologist and anthrax expert
 
“The title of US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy’s new book, The Wuhan Cover-Up, does not really represent the scope and nature of this seminal work. This book is the most comprehensive historic summary and indictment of the history of the United States’ biowarfare/biodefense program ever written. Summarizing an amazing sweep of untold censored history, The Wuhan Cover-Up offers a case study demonstrating the consequences of the situational ethical slide which often occurs when a massive administrative bureaucracy fuses with an &#39intelligence community.&#39”
—Robert W. Malone, MD, MS, virologist, immunologist, clinical research and regulatory affairs expert, and author of Lies My Gov’t Told Me
 
“RFK Jr.’s painstaking research reveals facts that anyone can confirm, but few can accept. Bioweapons research and production has a dark history many people would want to wish away. Kennedy’s compelling book makes that impossible.”
—Gavin de Becker, bestselling author of The Gift of Fear
 
“An extraordinary elucidation of a singularly dark and terrible enterprise. The Wuhan Cover-Up is a meticulous work of scholarship that reads like a thrilling crime story. Written by a current candidate for president of the United States, the book is destined to be one of the most significant in history.”
—Peter A. McCullough, MD, MPH, author of The Courage to Face COVID-19
 
“If you found Bobby Kennedy&#39s bestselling book, The Real Anthony Fauci, to be engaging and thought-provoking, then The Wuhan Cover-Up is a must-read for you. This compelling book can be considered the next installment in the series, delving into the intriguing history of the bioweapons-industrial complex and its clandestine utilization against humanity. Prepare to be captivated by the well-researched content that unveils the hidden truths behind bioweapons and their potential impact on us all.”
—Dr. Joseph Mercola, founder of Mercola.com, the most visited natural health site
 
“Robert Kennedy’s meticulously documented and powerful exposé in The Real Anthony Fauci alerted me to his stature as one of the most learned and courageous truth-tellers of our times. His new book on the history of bioweapons research, the incredible dangers it poses for mankind, and the almost unimaginable corruption in which it is enmeshed is a blockbuster of the same caliber. It reminds us not only that it is time we put this malefic ‘research’ to an end, but also rescue our government from the Washington cabals and special interest lobbies that control both political parties, thereby enabling a return to policies that support the middle class and make it possible for millions to once again experience the American Dream.”
—David Stockman, former US Representative (R-MI)
 
“I’ll never forget RFK Jr. telling me on a hiking trail in February 2023 that when you expose Big Pharma, you’re up against the Department of Defense. I’ll also never forget the Pfizer executive telling my undercover journalist, ‘You have to promise you won’t tell anyone . . . I suspect the virus started in Wuhan. Makes no sense the virus popped out of nowhere.’ Power hates sunlight, coercion relies upon deception, and informed consent requires a veil to be lifted. That’s what this book, The Wuhan Cover-Up does so effectively, much like its predecessor, The Real Anthony Fauci.”
—James O’Keefe, founder of Project Veritas and author of American Muckraker
 
“The greatest tragedy in human history has unfolded before our own eyes. I was not surprised to learn that a deadly virus, SARS-CoV2, had leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, China in the late summer of 2019. In retrospect, I was shocked that the US government did not notify and alert the public of the global spread of COVID in the fall of 2019. In fact, the US government did something far worse. Bobby’s book succinctly elucidates how and why the opaque nexus of the US military and intelligence community leveraged corrupt and morally deficient scientists and bureaucrats to execute what was the largest and most sophisticated psychological operation in world history. The three goals were simple: to obfuscate the true origin of a jointly created biological weapon by the US and China; to bring an untested mRNA-based medical countermeasure rapidly to market for civilian use; and, to instill fear into the population for dominance and control. Bobby’s book concisely and eloquently exposes these horrendous inconvenient truths.”
—Andrew G. Huff, PhD, author of The Truth About Wuhan
 
“Whenever I read, listen to, or debate Bobby, I learn something new and change my mind on at least one or two issues, while vehemently disagreeing with many others. Both the agreements and disagreements stimulate my thinking and emotions, even when they make me angry or concerned. Read him and make up your own minds.""

Praise for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and The Real Anthony Fauci

“Dr. Joseph Goebbels wrote that ‘A lie told once remains a lie, but a lie told a thousand times becomes the truth.’ Tragically for humanity, there are many, many untruths emanating from Fauci and his minions. RFK Jr exposes the decades of lies.”
—Luc Montagnier, Nobel laureate

“Bobby Kennedy is one of the bravest and most uncompromisingly honest people I’ve ever met. Someday he’ll get credit for it. In the meantime, read this book.”
&
""Despite all the lying, or maybe in reaction to it, Bobby is becoming a legitimate folk hero. I hear it all the time.""
—Tucker Carlson
 
“As a trial lawyer, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken on the world’s most powerful corporations and held them accountable for harming people and the environment. Those companies denied any wrongdoing—but time and again, judges and juries were persuaded that Kennedy’s position was the right one. Kennedy’s information should always be considered, and agree or disagree, we all learn from listening.”
—Tony Robbins, New York Times bestselling author
 
“Bobby Kennedy and I famously disagree about many aspects of the current debates surrounding Covid and vaccines. We also disagree about Dr Fauci. But I always learn when I read or hear Bobby’s take. So read this book and challenge its conclusions.”
—Alan Dershowitz, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus, at Harvard Law School; author of The Case for Vaccine Mandates 
 
“If you have any interest in doing a deep dive into the more than 100-year history of what led up to the COVID-19 pandemic, then The Real Anthony Fauci is an absolute must-read. In addition to exposing Fauci, the book reveals the complex web of connections between Gates and Big Pharma and many of the most important players that were responsible for seeking to implement global tyranny and profit enormously from the propaganda behind the COVID injections, masks, and lockdowns.”
—Dr. Joseph Mercola, founder of Mercola.com
 
“Bobby Kennedy’s book on The Real Anthony Fauci speaks truth in times when health care becomes health harm, untruth rules through anti-science and fake news.""

“I thought I understood what was going on from an insider POV. But this is mind-blowing. Anthony Fauci is playing precisely the strategy that he developed and tested during the HIV days. Bobby is on fire in this manuscript. The depth of information and facts, all carefully cited, is mind-blowing. It is a must-read. I think it will really help clarify what has been going down here. Thanks to the consistently dysfunctional COVID-19 response by Fauci and USG/HHS (US Government Health and Human Services Department), we have all become familiar with the terms ""regulatory capture"" and ""Noble Lie."" The personal opinion and bias of Dr. Fauci has been repeatedly substituted for evidence-based medicine, and we are all living with the consequences. But beyond this mundane incompetence, what this book clearly documents are the deeper forces and systemic, pervasive governmental corruption, which have led us to this point. Not since the reign of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, have we seen such empire building by a corrupt, longstanding federal employee who is long past retirement age. Dr. Fauci&#39s apparent need to bolster a fragile ego has led to the almost complete systemic corruption of not only US HHS, but the entire world public health system. The consequences will be lasting damage to the reputation of the United States of America, US FDA, and US CDC as honest, independent guardians of public health, which has been carefully nurtured over many decades. The world is now able to clearly see that the US HHS has been captured and compromised by commercial interests. One unintended consequence of allowing and enabling this tragedy will be further erosion in domestic trust in the Public Health System, and in particular, in the entire vaccine enterprise. Global impacts are likely to include accelerating loss of trust in US and western pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and more rapid rise of Asian, Indian, and Middle Eastern pharmaceutical competitors.""
—Robert W. Malone, MD, virologist, immunologist, molecular biologist

""Standing as a pivotal work for the history of science and medicine, this book unveils the astonishing, twisted truth about a man (Fauci) and a corrupt institution (NIH) that have betrayed humanity at every turn in order to achieve profits and power. If the American people knew the truth that&#39s documented here, they would be marching by the millions, demanding criminal prosecutions of all those who are complicit in these outrageous betrayals of humanity. RFK Jr&#39s book closes the loop on one of the most disastrous and truly evil schemes in the history of medicine and science. If humanity does not now demand investigations and prosecutions across this vast landscape of science fraud and pathological &#39authority,&#39 we are truly beyond hope.""
—Mike Adams, a.k.a. the ""Health Ranger,"" founder of NaturalNews.com

“If you&#39ve ever wondered why so many good scientists and doctors have been silenced for discoveries that don&#39t fit the mainstream Big Pharma narrative, look no further than Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39s tour de force exposé of Anthony Fauci. This book reads like a John Grisham legal thriller. Except that it is not fiction. Read it with your eyes wide open. It&#39s time the world woke up to the truth."" 
—Christiane Northrup, MD, former assistant clinical professor of Ob/Gyn, University of Vermont College of Medicine; New York Times bestselling author of Women&#39s Bodies, Women&#39s Wisdom

“Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did a great job. I don&#39t agree with everything, but his case is well laid out and copiously documented. The most disturbing things are the unbelievable financial entanglements, the shoddy treatment of patients in clinical trials, and the culture of intimidation. Overall a very good book and a call to overhaul the CDC/NIH.”

“Kennedy&#39s book proves beyond a shadow of doubt what many Americans have come to learn about Fauci: that he has stifled open debate to the point of utter stagnation of biomedical science. Fauci issues knowledge by decree. This most uninquisitive Fauci is far more concerned with being right and with making sure that the solutions adopted to problems come from his circle rather than in discovering fundamental truths, regardless of the completely externalized cost of his ‘solutions.’ The evidence shows plainly that Fauci has been wrong on matters of life and death far more than he has been right. Fauci&#39s resulting body count is such that he should have a statue erected with him posing and hanging his head in eternal shame. Thanks to this book, historians will mark Fauci down as the most dangerous threat to global public health in the 20th and 21st Centuries.”
—James Lyons-Weiler, biomedical research scientist

“RFK Jr.’s story of Fauci’s failure as the government’s AIDS coordinator is a highly disturbing prologue to his COVID mandate as head of NIAID. So, who is Dr. Fauci in the end? Has American medicine truly become a ‘racket,’ as corrupt as a mafia organization? Does everything in our country turn on the size of the money involved? How can we begin to solve this? The Real Anthony Fauci is a fascinating starting point. RFK Jr. has written a strong, strong book.” 
—Oliver Stone, award-winning director, producer, and screenwriter

“As I read Bobby Kennedy Jr.&#39s book I thought a discreet and thorough criminal investigation into Fauci should occur. Having observed Fauci&#39s flip-flops on his statements on the COVID pandemic, coupled with the book’s descriptions by former coworkers as ‘neither a competent manager . . . nor skilled or devoted scientist . . . with a domineering nature toward subordinates and rivals that discouraged dissent, a foundation for an investigation exists. The conduct cited, involving the CDC&#39s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices approval of a vaccine and how Fauci and his Pharma partners use their PIs to control the key FDA and CDC panels that license and ‘recommend’ new vaccines, is a red flag that warrants this investigation. The book cites an approval of a vaccine, whereby there was no testing of a vaccine against a placebo in pre-approval trials that is a standard scientific process to ‘predict’ and/or determine risks if the vaccines would avert more injuries than they would cause—and the vaccine was approved. This appears to be similar to what happened with the Covid vaccines. The Covid clinical trials were not in accordance with prescribed regulations. It brought back memories of criminal bid-rigging schemes conducted by Organized Crime in New York City. If an investigation identified intentional rampant fraud, vaccine deaths could be considered murders and the federal forfeitures would be billions of dollars.”  
—Mike Campi, former FBI agent and retired coordinator of the Organized Crime branch of the New York Division

“Who—or what—is the real Anthony Fauci? That may be the most important question facing us today, as We the People struggle to survive the lethal care of ‘America&#39s Doctor.’ This essential book reveals—at last!—that Dr. Fauci is, on the one hand, a severely twisted person, in his fiendish cunning, vindictiveness, and ruthlessness, a covert blend of Stalin and Iago; and yet, far more importantly, the story of Dr. Fauci&#39s rise and reign is really all about the absolute corruption of our major institutions—government, medicine, academia, and (above all) the press—by Big Pharma (and the Gates Foundation). Those of us who really do believe in science and democracy, now have this book to help us break his fatal spell on everybody else, and start to rid the world of that corruption.”
—Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies at New York University; editor, News from Underground

“RFK Jr is a tireless champion of Americans’ rights to be informed about their medical choices and has been way out front in warning us of the dangers of an out-of-control pharmaceutical industry. In his new book, The Real Anthony Fauci, he turns the same relentless insider scrutiny on an out-of-control bureaucracy.”
—Naomi Wolf, bestselling author of The Beauty Myth, Give Me Liberty, and Outrages

""Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has written the Rosetta Stone that will help the public finally understand the machinations of Dr. Anthony Fauci, and how he has acted as the puppet master of science for the last half-century—pulling the strings of public health and Big Pharma influence and causing both sides of the political aisle to dance to his tune. A must-read to understand the fake news about medicine and therapies, bought and paid for by corporations with billions of dollars at stake.""
—Kent Heckenlively, attorney, science teacher, and New York Times bestselling author

“Throughout history, fear has been used to manipulate and control populations. In a democracy, we have the privilege and responsibility to question the things we are encouraged to fear. Robert F.

—Gavin de Becker, bestselling author of The Gift of Fear

""If you want to understand the role Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Big Pharma, the CDC, WHO, intelligence agencies and others played in planning, launching, and profiting from the COVID pandemic, drop what you’re doing and read this powerful and meticulously researched book! Your future, your family&#39s future, and the future of our democracy are at stake.”

“At the beginning of the COVID pandemic, a leader rose to the stage, and his soft voice and welcoming smile drew us in, and we trusted him emphatically. After reading Bobby Kennedy’s earth-shattering book, The Real Anthony Fauci, it is clear that our trusted COVID leader shouldn’t be on a pedestal and should instead be on trial. This book is a must-read for anyone wondering why the United States of America refused to mandate wellness and instead pushed a problematic vaccine.”

Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,"“Millions of people—myself included—initially believed the Covid-19 vaccine disaster to be a one-off, the result of a novel, rapidly evolving virus combined with a rushed therapeutic packaged in an experimental delivery system. Today I laugh at such naiveté. In Vax-Unvax, Kennedy and Hooker shine a blinding light on the appalling lack of research and blatant propaganda behind the entire inflated and ever-expanding childhood vaccine schedule. The authors’ painstaking investigation and rigorous analyses are rivaled only by their bravery in exposing the depth and breadth of the lies we’ve been told. As a physician who never dreamed of questioning the safety and efficacy claims of routine immunizations and who believed he was protecting his patients and his own children by endorsing them, I am humbled and enraged. Our government, the media, and the powerful and rapacious pharmaceutical industrial complex have deceived, endangered, and gaslit the public for far too long. I hope this explosive and important book finds a worldwide audience and becomes a staple in every pediatrician’s and parent’s library.”
—Dr. Pierre Kory, author of The War on Ivermectin, cofounder of the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, cofounder of the Leading Edge Tele-Health Clinic
 
“As the threat of fatal infectious diseases in childhood has dissipated, there has been a lagged increase in the intensity of vaccination for rare illnesses. Modern treatment and supportive care have taken much of the concern out of the infections on the childhood vaccine schedule. However, with the rise of hyper-vaccination, Kennedy and Hooker uncover a concurrent explosion of childhood allergic, immune, and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Massive systemic perturbation of the immune system with indiscriminate immunization has come at a sobering cost. Read Vax-Unvax carefully and keep it close at hand—this dawn of a new age in public health will be tumultuous for years to come.”
—Dr. Peter McCullough, author of The Courage to Face COVID-19

“In this book, Kennedy and Hooker provide the complete, definitive demolition of the mythos and propaganda that tells the public vaccines improve the health of children. Not a plank of this false house remains by the end of this book. The lies are dismantled in cool, clear language void of bombast, which allows the facts, figures, and data to shine through, to a devastating conclusion. This is the book you can hand to people who are still in trance states about vaccines.”
—Celia Farber, journalist and author of Serious Adverse Events

“‘The Science’ is finally here in one place. If you want to follow the science related to vaccines and health problems, this is a must read. With over one hundred references, the actual harm being caused by vaccines is exposed. Parents, don&#39t listen to an authority figure without doing your own research. This book is required reading for every informed parent.”
—Paul Thomas, MD, author of The Vaccine-Friendly Plan and The Addiction Spectrum; founder and host of With the Wind: Science Revealed; cofounder KidsFirst4Ever.com

“This clear, compelling, timely book lays to rest most myths about the ‘science’ and safety of many existing vaccines and exposes shoddy testing, shocking damage to health, and corrupt business practices. An important follow-up to Kennedy’s The Real Anthony Fauci.”
—Naomi Wolf, bestselling author of The Beauty Myth and The Bodies of Others
 
“While the CDC continues to refuse to do the type of vaccinated versus unvaccinated study that parents have long been demanding, independent researchers have forged ahead, and the results are now quite clear: unvaccinated children are healthier. In Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Brian Hooker review that data as well as many additional studies comparing health outcomes between those who did or did not receive individual vaccines. This is an essential resource for the serious researcher and a valuable guide for anyone wishing to exercise truly informed consent. The graphs helpfully included with the discussion of each study covered speak for themselves. It is past time for the ‘public health’ establishment to stop deceiving the public with their proclamations of official dogma about the ostensible safety of these pharmaceutical products.”
—Jeremy R. Hammond, independent journalist and author of The War on Informed Consent
 
“In 1999, I gave a vaccine that caused such a bad side effect that it altered the trajectory of my patient’s life. Thus began my journey into vaccine safety research. This book is a great compilation of scientific studies you never heard about on the news. With easy-to-understand graphics and explanations of statistics, you can analyze data from clinicians and researchers from around the world. You may find yourself doubting the simplistic ‘safe and effective’ doctrine repeated by health authorities. You will find yourself more empowered to make vaccine decisions for your child.”
—Elizabeth Mumper, MD, IFMCP, president & CEO, Rimland Center for Integrative Medicine
 
“RFK Jr. and Dr. Hooker present the science that supports what I have personally witnessed in my twenty-five years as a pediatrician—unvaccinated children are healthier and have fewer chronic medical problems compared to vaccinated kids. Today’s parents, and a growing number of my colleagues, are now coming to recognize this grand irony in our modern pediatric health care system.""
—Dr. Bob Sears, author of The Vaccine Book and host of TheVaccineConversation.com podcast
 
“Bobby Kennedy and Brian Hooker are tireless heroes on the front line of a great battle to protect our health freedom. Biomedical studies are being falsified and the masses are being deceived by health authorities, the vaccine industry, and a complicit media. Read this book and let the true science speak!”
 —Neil Z. Miller, author of Miller&#39s Review of Critical Vaccine Studies
 
“When I met Dr. Hooker on August 29, 2014, he was more than a decade into his relentless efforts through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to reveal not only the studies the CDC refused to do but the plague of corruption surrounding CDC whistleblower William Thompson’s confession regarding the censorship and fraud in the MMR vaccine trial by the CDC to cover up the fraud in the in clinical literature surrounding all vaccines. Stunned by the blatant corruption in Dr. Hooker’s presentation that day, Kent Heckenlively and I, in collaboration with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., began to write Plague of Corruption. Throughout 2019, Dr. Hooker and Kennedy collaborated to reveal much of the CDC, FDA, and NIH corruption in the thirty-four page foreword to Plague of Corruption that revealed manipulation of hundreds of basic research studies showing dangers of xenotransplantation, microbial contamination, and environmental toxins including mercury, aluminum, PEG, and the corruption of the agencies tasked to protect public health. 
     Vax-Unvax is the result of their heroic effort to reveal the censored science and truth behind the role of a failure by these agencies tasked to conduct safety studies in three decades of liability-free vaccines and the resultant explosion of chronic disease and disability facing our world today. Given the massive push to vaccinate a new generation, this book is a must read supporting a moratorium on inoculations in favor of oral and mucosal immunization strategies.”
—Judy A. Mikovits, PhD

“In Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak, authors Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Brian Hooker have provided a deep dive into vaccine safety by looking at published data from independent researchers. The resulting review of vaccinated and unvaccinated children&#39s health outcomes clearly shows the damage, much of it neurological, that blind adherence to the CDC&#39s current vaccine schedule can induce. The studies highlighted are those that both the FDA and CDC have routinely refused, and continue to refuse, to do themselves. The official reason for not providing such studies is based on the erroneous notion that conducting vaccinated-unvaccinated evaluations would somehow be ‘unethical.’ Kennedy and Hooker demolish this argument and then proceed to review the safety of different vaccines, many that contain adjuvant aluminum or Thimerosal, the latter an ethyl mercury compound. Overall, for those trying to understand the often-confusing claims and counterclaims, particularly lay people, the book provides some badly needed clarity.
     The book also considers the current Covid-19 mRNA vaccines in context to the older childhood vaccine platforms. This is a particularly timely contribution in that the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting vaccine mandates have paradoxically served to make more people question the official  ‘safe and effective’ mantra that tends to surround all vaccines: If the conventional vaccine platforms using compounds with aluminum and mercury are not safe, then why should anyone trust the completely new and largely experimental vaccine platforms developed for Covid (and soon numerous vaccines)? For parents it can be both confusing and frightening to consider the pros and cons of vaccines against childhood diseases: What if they make the wrong decision, in either direction, and their child is harmed?
     While many in the medical profession may not like the book because it exposes the outright deception of the pharmaceutical industry, the CDC and FDA, I strongly believe that many parents, or parents-to-be, will be grateful for the information it contains. Simply put, at the end of the day the ability to consider all aspects of vaccine safety in order to make an informed choice for one&#39s children, or oneself, is an absolutely critical aspect of real health freedom. In turn, health freedom is intimately tied to the concept of ‘security of the person,’ perhaps the most fundamental of natural rights.  
     Kennedy and Hooker should be commended for tackling this crucial issue in order to bring clarity to the mass of ‘dis-’ and ‘mis-’ information peddled by the health establishment and the mainstream media. If indeed the ‘truth can set you free,’ then this book is a huge step in the right direction.”
—Christopher Shaw, neuroscientist and professor of ophthalmology at University of British Columbia, author of Dispatches from the Vaccine Wars

“If there is only one book you read in your entire life, let it be this one! If you want the science to speak . . . then have the courage to look at the actual science, data, and truth found in the pages of Vax-Unvax. Arm yourself with the information that puts the power back into the hands of parents where it belongs, not in the hands of corrupt Pharma, captured government officials, and incentivized doctors spouting catch phrases with little to no evidence to back it up. RFK Jr. and Dr. Brian Hooker are the bold voices of truth, presenting evidence that cannot be disputed. The main purpose of a parent is to love your child and keep them safe. If you have not had the courage before, I boldly implore you to find the courage now, and educate before you vaccinate!”

Dr. Steven R Gundry MD,"Go Lectin-Free with The Plant Paradox 30-Day Challenge!
In Dr. Steven Gundry’s breakout bestseller The Plant Paradox, readers learned the surprising truth about food that has long been regarded as healthy. Lectins—a type of protein found in fruit, vegetables, legumes, dairy products, and grains—wreak havoc on the gut, creating systemic inflammation and laying the groundwork for disease and weight gain. Avoiding lectins offers incredible health benefits but requires a significant lifestyle change—one that, for many people, can feel overwhelming.
Now Dr. Gundry makes it simpler than ever to go lectin-free with his 30-day program. With a simplified overview of The Plant Paradox as well as meal plans, food lists, time-saving cooking strategies, and all-new recipes, he offers a complete tool kit for success. In addition, families with young children and readers with specialized dietary needs will find tips and modifications to make the plan work for their lifestyle.

Cara McGoogan,"Told with page-turning pace, a forensic grasp of detail and deep human compassion, The Poison Line is the gripping tale of a terrible scandal. It turns on the hubris of doctors, the folly of politicians and, above all, the greed of some of the world&#39s biggest drug companies. At its centre, are the people - many of them children - who trusted those who promised to heal them and paid an unforgivable price for that trust. In telling their story, and laying bare a cover-up maintained over four decades, Cara McGoogan has done them - and all of us - an essential service -- Jonathan Freedland, author of The Escape Artist

Beautifully written, as vivid as it is light-fingered, this is also a devastating piece of reportage. Books are routinely described as extraordinary, but this one really is -- John Preston, author of Fall

In The Poison Line, Cara McGoogan masterfully unveils the depths of a scandal with precision and clarity. Through meticulous investigation and compelling storytelling, McGoogan not only brings to light the grave injustices suffered by victims but also underscores the vital importance of transparency and accountability in a world all too willing to hide uncomfortable truths. Her work serves as a beacon for those of us dedicated to uncovering facts in the service of justice and human rights -- Eliot Higgins, author of We Are Bellingcat

A revelatory work of non-fiction . . . The Poison Line renders personal tragedy on a mass scale: it’s a shuddering achievement -- Simon Ings ― Telegraph

Factor VIII was supposed to be a miracle treatment for the clotting disorder haemophilia but instead became an agent of death . . . pharmaceutical companies, governments and medical bodies conspired to keep the global scandal under wraps, despite whistleblower evidence. A deeply shocking account of medical injustice -- Anjana Ahuja ― Financial Times, Best Books of 2023

This is a vital account of the infected blood scandal and subsequent cover-up, which caused enormous harm to so many people. The truth must be told, no matter how hard it is, for the system to change -- Andy Burnham

The motivation of the companies producing Factor VIII in the US was clear: profit . . . As McGoogan points out, the parallels with the present-day opioid crisis in the US are clear -- Florence Sutcliffe-Braithwaite ― London Review of Books

A powerful read . . . grounded as it is in emotive stories and dramatic language, while covering the more expansive international contexts in which medical decision-making takes place -- Fay Bound Alberti ― Times Literary Supplement

Both a riveting thriller and a devastating investigation that is all the more infuriating and gripping because everything in its pages happened to innocent children and their families, in corporations&#39 careless quest for profits. Once you plunge into this story, you will be holding onto your seat and turning the pages to see what terrible fate will befall young hemophiliacs who were kept in the dark for actual years about the fatal virus lurking in their medical treatments, and whether the doctors who violated their oath to protect their patients and the pharmaceutical companies who lied about their contaminated blood will finally get just punishment -- Carol Leonnig, author of Zero Fail and three-time Pulitzer Prize winner

Cara McGoogan’s The Poison Line is a brilliant act of investigative cartography, tracking the virus-ridden blood packs from their source (a prison in Louisiana) to patients in the US, the UK and beyond ― Prospect, Books of the Year 2023

This is an absolutely invaluable work of investigation, a book that terrifies and enrages, and a ferociously brave model of truth-telling -- Juliet Nicolson ― author of Frostquake

This deeply moving account of the infected blood scandal is a must read. Though devastating, the humanity and courage of the patients and campaigners shines through on every page. I loved this book -- Dr Jim Down ― author of Life in the Balance

Cara McGoogan is an indefatigable detective and a born storyteller -- Steve Coll, author of Ghost Wars, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, staff writer at The New Yorker

The distressing details are laid out in forensic and heart-wrenching detail . . . McGoogan documents the near-incomprehensible scale of lies and deception that define this scandal – most egregiously the cover-up by doctors, pharmaceutical companies and governments who went on allowing infectious products to be used while aware they were potentially deadly -- Phoebe Davis ― Tortoise

A hugely impressive work of reportage, The Poison Line is a gripping and moving account of a shocking true story. Cara McGoogan’s meticulous research and skilful writing are made all the more powerful by her deep compassion for the victims of this appalling and maddening tragedy -- Ben Hinshaw, author of Exactly What You Mean

A riveting story of pharmaceutical and government malfeasance and cover up that left a trail of death and misery in its wake. Cara McGoogan&#39s in-depth reporting and seamless writing makes The Poison Line the definitive account of one of modern medicine&#39s most chilling scandals -- Gerald Posner, Pulitzer Prize Finalist and author of Pharma: Greed, Lies, and the Poisoning of America

I’ll never be the same. No one who reads it will -- Tom Mull, lawyer at Mull & Mull who fought Alpha, Armour, Baxter and Bayer for a decade

An incredibly powerful and important piece of reporting filled with so much anger and sadness from the first to last page -- Heather Darwent, author of The Things We Do To Our Friends

A fluidly written, deeply reported and ambitious exposé . . . The author displays an eye for the poignant detail -- Sarah Neville ― Financial Times

Tells the full story of the infected blood scandal over more than 40 years -- Eleanor Peake ― i

My first introduction to Cara McGoogan&#39s work was her expertly researched and presented Bed of Lies, not only a masterclass in compelling storytelling in audio but also on holding power to account. Her journalistic instinct to illuminate corruption and institutional abuse, partnered with her delicate and nuanced style, makes her work unmissable -- Alice Levine, TV and radio presenter, and host of the Wondery podcast British Scandal

Cara McGoogan is a dogged reporter whose investigation is a timely one. I can&#39t wait to read her book -- Joshua Hunt, author of University of Nike

McGoogan tenaciously tells the appalling story of this scandal and the lengths to which Big Pharma and governments went to cover it up -- Bookseller",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/o6uogd2rsq070aqc10j028etpj._SY600_.jpg

Introduction
Ours is a domesticated age. As civilization has advanced over the march of millennia, humans have assiduously stripped the animal kingdom of its armies, decommissioned its officers. Some erstwhile adversaries we have hunted to extinction, or nearly so. Others we confine to zoos, to child-friendly safari parks. The balance we shunt to the margins as we clear their land for ourselves—erecting our own sprawling habitats on the ruins of theirs, naming our cul-de-sacs for whatever wilderness we dozed to pave them.
Peer through news reports, though, and one can find pockets of resistance, as if some ancient animal essence were periodically reawakening. Consider the bobcat in Cottonwood, Arizona, that set out on a rampage one recent March evening, menacing a worker outside a Pizza Hut and then sauntering into a bar, sending patrons onto the pool table, mauling the one who dared to snap a picture on his phone. Or the furious otter in Vero Beach, Florida, at a waterfront golf community called Grand Harbor (a “gated enclave,” brags its website, “for those seeking the ultimate resort-at-home lifestyle”), that gnawed three residents, one of them while out on the links. Or the enraged beaver at the Loch Raven Reservoir, in the genteel exurban sprawl north of Baltimore, that cruelly interrupted the summertime reverie of four swimmers, a nightmare that ended only when the husband of one pulled the beaver from his wife’s upper thigh and smashed it with a rock.
Typically these creatures will shun the society of humans. But in an instant we can find them transformed into bewilderingly avid attackers, accosting us as we retrieve our mail or walk our dogs, sometimes even carrying out a home invasion. A particularly harrowing tale comes to us from the Adirondack hamlet of Lake George, N.Y. On an April evening just a few years ago, a young couple was walking from their car when they were set upon by a gray fox. The two managed to rush inside their home and close the door. But nearly a half hour later, when they opened the door again, the fox lay in wait; it sprinted toward the opening; only quick reflexes allowed the young man to close it just as the creature’s snout broached the threshold. When an animal control officer arrived, the fox attacked his SUV, repeatedly sinking its teeth into his tires. He shot at it multiple times from out his driver’s side window, but failed to hit his mark. Later, after the officer had finally run the fox over, he told a reporter that it was the single most aggressive foe he had encountered in nine years on the job. “This was a four- or five-pound animal attacking a 3,000-pound vehicle,” he said.
The sheer tenacity: that is the truly chilling element in all these tales. “What disturbs me,” remarked one Connecticut man to the local news, regarding the raccoon he had lately beaten to death with a hammer, “is I smashed his mouth off, I smashed his teeth in, but he still wanted to continue in the attack mode. I was actually terrified at the resilience of this animal.” In Pittsfield, Mass., on a sleepy street backing up to the Housatonic River, a fox attacked twice in an eight-hour span. In the first incident, one neighbor struck the fox multiple times with the lid to his barbecue smoker. Yet still the fox returned earlier the next morning, biting the girl next door; it took twenty minutes for the man and her sister to pry the fox off her leg, before the man could knock the fox unconscious and then choke it to extinction.
One victim in Putnam County, New York, survived her own interminable ordeal with a raccoon, which assaulted her at the end of her half-mile-long driveway. She held down the snarling beast while she tried to free her cellphone to call the house; eventually, her husband and son had to club the raccoon repeatedly with a tire iron before it died. (“I felt that nature had betrayed me,” she later told a reporter for the public-radio show This American Life.)Then there was the red fox in South Carolina that pursued a nine-year-old as he made his way to the school bus one morning. After an adult neighbor sheltered the boy in his house, the fox latched onto the good Samaritan’s foot. He flung the animal into his home office, where it flailed against the walls and windows before finally falling asleep on a dog bed.
Nearly any species can be afflicted. Arizona officials were recently called to the scene after a dog was attacked by a mad peccary, a pig-like creature whose residence in the southwest had until that point been considered largely peaceable. In Robbins, N.C., it was a skunk that beset the pet Pekinese of David Sanders, who was forced to watch the two creatures battle it out for the better part of an hour. (Sanders was unable to shoot the challenger, he explained, because all he had at hand was a shotgun.) In Decatur County, Ga., a donkey fell prey to the madness and bit its owner on the hand. In Imperial, Nebraska, the afflicted animal was literally a lamb, part of a child’s 4-H project gone terribly, almost Biblically awry. Some primeval force must truly be at work when the lamb can be made into a lion.
***
The agent of all these diabolical acts of possession is, of course, a virus. It is the most fatal virus in the world, a pathogen that kills 100 percent of its hosts in most species, including humans. Fittingly, the rabies virus is shaped like a bullet: a cylindrical shell of glycoproteins and lipids that carries, in its rounded tip, a malevolent payload of helical RNA. On entering a living thing, it eschews the bloodstream, the default route of most viruses but a path fraught with danger from immuno-protective sentries. Instead, like almost no other virus known to science, rabies sets its course through the nervous system, creeping upstream at one to two centimeters per day (on average) through the axoplasm, the transmission lines that conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain. Once inside the brain, the virus works slowly, diligently, fatally to warp the mind, suppressing the rational and stimulating the animal. Aggression rises to fever pitch; inhibitions melt away; salivation is ratcheted up. The infected creature now has only days to live, and these he will likely spend on the attack, foaming at the mouth, chasing and lunging and biting in the throes of madness—because the demon that possesses him seeks more hosts.
If this sounds like a horror movie, we should not be surprised, for it is a scenario bound up into our very concept of horror. Rabies is a scourge as old as human civilization, and the terror of its manifestation is a fundamental human fear, because it challenges the boundary of humanity itself. That is, it troubles the line where man ends and animal begins—for the rabid bite is the visible symbol of the animal infecting the human, of an illness in a creature metamorphosing demonstrably into that same illness in a person.
Today, we understand that more than half our new diseases (60 percent, by a recent tally in Nature) are “zoonotic,” i.e. originating in animal populations, and our widespread fear of the worst of these (swine flu, AIDS, West Nile, Ebola) has been colored by our knowledge of their bestial origins. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that nothing has made humans sicker than our association with animals. Not only our emerging diseases today but the major killers throughout the ages—smallpox, tuberculosis, malaria, influenza—evolved from similar diseases in animals. This is what Jared Diamond has called “the lethal gift of livestock,” a major shaper of human destiny; the very fact that the agricultural lifestyle won out over that of the hunter-gatherer is due in part, Diamond argues, because the former “breathed out nastier germs.” Through their close contact with livestock, early farmers built up immunity to illnesses that would readily kill unexposed populations, a dynamic that still holds for emerging infectious diseases today.
Yet until the early twentieth century, humans had no idea that so many of its illnesses derived from animals. During those years when the most catastrophic zoonosis in history struck—the fourteenth-century Black Death, or bubonic plague, which spreads to humans via fleas living on the backs of rats and other rodents—scholars blamed nearly everything else, from demonic forces and bad air to astronomical happenings and even human malefactors. For centuries, rabies was the only illness in which the animalistic transfer, or more like a transformation, was clear. No microscope was required to see the possession take place. A mad animal bit; a mad man appeared; each would die a terrible death. The madness could lurk within any beast, even in—especially in—the most domesticated and loyal of all, the dog.
As the unique mode of animal to human infection, rabies has always shaded into something more supernatural: into animal metamorphoses, into monstrous hybridities. When Greek myth beholds Lycaon, king of Arcadia, as he transforms into a slavering wolf, his countenance is “rabid,” his jaws “bespluttered with foam.” In fifteenth-century Spain, witch-hunters called saludadores were reputed, also, as healers of rabies, a convergence that makes eminent sense given the widely-held association between witches and demonic canine familiars. Between the fifteenth and eighteenth century, Europe gestated two enduring legends whose part-human, part-animal malefactors bite their victims, thereby passing along their own degraded conditions—namely, the werewolf and the vampire, both of whom haunt the Western imagination to the present day. As Susan Sontag pointed out, even as late as the nineteenth century, when viruses were becoming well understood and a rabies vaccine lay just around the corner, the true source of the rabies panics in France was not the fatality of the disease but rather the “fantasy”—though one might accurately say the fact—“that infection transformed people into maddened animals.”
Paradoxically, during the twentieth century, after Pasteur’s invention of a rabies vaccine provided a near-foolproof means of preventing its fatality in humans, our dark fascination with rabies seemed only to swell. The vaccine itself became as mythologized as the bug, such that even today, many Americans believe that treatment requires some twenty (or is it thirty?) shots, delivered with a footlong syringe into the stomach. (It’s four shots, for the record, and not particularly deep in the arm.) Even as vaccination of dogs in the United States was reducing the infection rate in that species down to negligible levels, a generation of children learned to scrutinize their pet pooches for the slightest signs of madness, largely thanks to the malign influence of Old Yeller, a Walt Disney film about a frontier-era boy who falls in love with a yellow dog that becomes rabid. Twenty-five years later, a novel called Cujo (and its subsequent film adaptation) taught a whole new generation to fear rabies, albeit a bit more forthrightly: no one finished the book or left the theater surprised by what became of that nice dog.
It’s almost as if the very anachronism of rabies, to the Western mind, has rendered it even more intriguing to us. Like the vampire, rabies carries with it the musty whiff of a centuries-old terror, even as it still terrifies us in the present day. Lately, TV comedians have taken to seizing on it for a laugh: two animated series created by Mike Judge, King of the Hill and Beavis and Butt-head, have both done episodes on rabies, as did the long-running medical comedy Scrubs. In the U.S. version of The Office, Michael Scott (the bumbling boss played by Steve Carell), tries to paper over the fact that he has hit an employee with her car by organizing a charity “race for the cure.” The disease he chooses is rabies. The boss soon becomes perplexed at how few donations are forthcoming:
Michael Scott: I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. How’s that going?
Pam Beesly: Not well. A doctor won’t come out to collect a check for 700 dollars. Or 500 dollars, if we go with the giant check. And also, there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
***
Contrary to what your television may have told you, there are most assuredly still rabies doctors, and humans still die in the tens of thousands from the disease (55,000, in the latest estimate)—just not usually in the United States, or in Western Europe. The dead hail overwhelmingly from Asia and Africa, from countries where vaccination is too expensive or too difficult to procure. And the course of their suffering is every bit as grim, and as inevitably fatal, as the course endured by victims throughout the millennia.
Indeed, other than the wide availability of painkillers, which can help stifle the final agonies of the disease, the sequence of horrors faced by a rabies patient today is hardly different from those experienced by the man who was probably the most eminent rabies victim in history: Charles Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond, who for the two years leading up to his death in 1819 served as Governor-General of Canada, the top post in what was then still a colonial government. The Duke was a famous lover of dogs; a portrait of Lennox as a boy shows the young nobleman reclining against a tree stump as an adoring spaniel paws at his finery. Ironically, it was not a dog but rather a fox, the ostensibly tame pet of a solider whose garrison the Duke had occasion to inspect in Quebec, whose jaws were to blame for his demise. When the fox tangled with his own dog—Blucher, so named in honor of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, the Prussian general who had recently bested Napoleon at Waterloo—Lennox stepped in to separate them. The mad fox seized this chance to insult the visiting head of state, chomping down hard on the base of his thumb.
After a bite, the rabies virus binds quickly into the peripheral nerves but then makes its course with almost impossible sloth, requiring usually at least three weeks and often as long as three months to arrive at and penetrate the brain; on rare occasions a full year, or even five years, can elapse before the onset of symptoms. During this time the wound will heal over, and the victim may even forget about his scrape with a snarling beast. But healed or no, as the virus enters the brain the wound will usually seem to return, as if by magic, with some odd sensation occurring at the site. This sensation can take many forms: stabbing pain, or numbness; burning, or unnatural cold; tingling, or itching, or even a tremor. At roughly the same time, these soon-to-be-doomed patients typically display general signs of influenza, with a fever and perhaps a sore throat or some mild nausea. In the case of the Duke of Richmond, it began one day with shoulder pains and a sore throat, then progressed the following day to insomnia and fatigue.
All this is merely prelude to the illness itself, whose most notable symptom in humans—unique, as far as physicians know, to rabies among all diseases —is a terrifying condition called hydrophobia. As the term suggests, hydrophobia is a fear of water, though the word “fear” does not do justice to the eerie and fully physical manner in which it manifests. Present the hydrophobic patient with a cup of water and, though he desperately wants to drink it, his entire body rebels against the consummation of this act. The outstretched arm jerks away just as it is about to bring the cup to the parched lips. Other times the entire body convulses at the thought. Just beholding the water can make the diaphragm involuntarily contract, causing patients to gag and retch. On YouTube one can find video from a 2007 sufferer in Vietnam, showing the travails of a middle-aged construction worker is valiantly attempting to consume some dark beverage from a clear plastic cup. He brings the vessel two thirds of the distance to his lips before his hands begin to tremble uncontrollably. He stares at the fluid, mouth agape, his twitching hands sloshing it over the sides. Finally he forces himself to bring the tiniest sip into his mouth and, overcoming the revulsion in his gullet, to swallow it.
For the Duke of Richmond, though the chronology remains in some dispute, the hydrophobia seems to have struck first on the evening of August 26th, 1819. At dinner with his officers, he found that his glass of claret disagreed with him. “I don’t know how it is,” he is said to have remarked to Colonel Francis Cockburn, one of his retinue, “but I cannot relish my wine tonight as usual. I feel that if I were a dog I should be shot for a mad one!”
The next day, the Duke ate and drank almost nothing and remained in bed. By the evening, he found he could not drink at all. The following morning, a doctor prescribed a gargle, but this, too, had a “convulsive” affect on his throat. He could not even accept his customary shave, so repelled was he by the water in the basin. This day he dragged himself from his bed, because he was scheduled to tour the swamps around the Ontario town of Richmond, recently renamed as such in his honor. But his body rebelled as he stepped into the boat. In terror he jumped back to the shore. Taken to the closest house, he begged to be moved farther from land: the very sound of running water had become unbearable to him. He was moved to a barn and laid down on a deathbed of straw.
Fevers spike high during this final phase of the disease, as the body succumbs to its grip in other, literally visceral ways. The mouth salivates profusely. Tears stream from the eyes. Goosebumps break out on the skin. Cries of agony, as expressed through a spasming throat, can produce the impression of an almost animal bark. In the throes of their convulsions, patients have even been known to bite. At the height of an attack, they also hallucinate. The eminent French physician Armand Trousseau, who practiced in the middle part of the nineteenth century, noted that “the patient is seized with sudden terror; he turns abruptly round, fancying that somebody calls to him.” He cited a case of colleague, one Dr. Bergeron, whose rabies patient “heard the ringing of bells, and saw mice run about on his bed.”
Not uncommonly, male patients succumb to an even more lurid sort of abandon. The virus’s action on the limbic system of the brain can cause them to exhibit hypersexual behavior: increased desire, involuntary erections, and even orgasms, sometimes occurring at a rate of once per hour. If the Duke of Richmond evidenced this symptom, his companions were too gallant to set it down for posterity. But other case reports from history describe up to thirty ejaculations in a single day. The Roman physician Galen, in his own remarks on rabies, describes the case of an unfortunate porter who suffered such emissions for three full days leading up to his death. Commenting on this last case, the eighteenth-century Austrian physician Gerard van Sieten soberly noted, Semen et animam simul efflavit: His seed and his life were lost at the same time.
Despite all the horrors of hydrophobia, arguably the most horrifying aspect is that fact that the attacks will usually subside, for a time, allowing patients periods of terrible lucidity: they are given the opportunity to fully contemplate what their condition portends. Before his death, the Duke dictated a lengthy letter to his eldest daughter, and also gave instructions that his beloved Blucher be handed over to her. “It will make her cry at first,” he said, “but turn him in when she is alone and shut the door.”

By now it should be apparent that this book is not for the squeamish or weak-kneed. Encounters with rabies have ever been thus. Louis Pasteur and his assistants, in order to develop their vaccine, had to corral dogs at the apex of their madness and extract deadly slaver from their snarling jaws. Axel Munthe, a Swedish physician, once saw Pasteur perform this trick with a glass tube held in his mouth, as two confederates with gloved hands pinned down a rabid bulldog. Some members of his team soon established a ghoulish failsafe for these procedures. “At the beginning of each session a loaded revolver was placed within their reach,” recalled Marie Cressac, the niece of Pasteur collaborator Emile Roux. “If a terrible accident were to happen to one of them, the more courageous of the two others would put a bullet in his head.”
We cannot claim so much bravado for this volume, on either our account or yours. A better analogy, perhaps, is the difficult process by which veterinarians submit suspect pets for rabies testing—another case study in how this diabolical disease causes nothing but agony for those who hope to behold it. Even today, vets do not use a blood test for rabies in animals; it’s not a pinprick and wait-and-see affair. Only a sampling from the animal’s brain will suffice. Therefore the animal must be killed, with its head removed and shipped off to authorities for study.
The first part of that process—capturing, and humanely dispatching, a deranged animal—is fairly standard stuff for your local vet. But carrying out a decapitation, even of a smallish creature, is much harder than they make it look in slasher pics. This is true not just for the obvious emotional reason: that in many cases, the vet had been trying to save the life of this beloved pet just hours beforehand. It’s also an ordeal in the purely practical sense. The carcass must be hauled onto a treatment table, which usually is reserved for care of the living, but which is the only surface equipped to handle the copious blood that might flow from a newly dead animal. The cadaver is laid out on its back, contorted face cocked skyward. With a scalpel the vet slices readily though the soft tissue around the animal’s neck: fur and skin, muscles and vessels, esophagus and trachea.
Now the vet is stuck with the problem of the spine, the very conduit through which the rabies virus may—or may not—have passed; like Schrödinger’s cat, the animal must be dead for this question to unravel. If the vet is lucky, her hospital has seen enough suspected rabies cases that it has thought to keep a hacksaw handy. In that case, she can take a brute-force path through bone, sawing straight through the tightly interlocked top vertebrae, the axis and atlas. If she is not so lucky, she will have only her scalpel to work with. A ten-minute job can thereby stretch out to forty-five, as she is forced to disarticulate those two top backbones, severing the tendons than bind them and separating one from the other: a decidedly grisly brainteaser.
To be honest, our tour through the four-thousand-year history of rabies has felt a little like that. Sometimes whole weeks got lost in a blur of blood and fur. Our explorations into the cultural meaning of rabies took us deep into the grisliest medical case reports, from ancient and modern times. Then they flung us out again, into the murky realm of myth, to dog-headed men and zombie mobs and the mass butchering of Cairo’s pigs. We’ve made pilgrimages to the Ardennes, to see the site of the holy rabies cure; to the Rue d’Ulm in Paris, to see the spot where Pasteur performed his heroics; and to the island of Bali, where we finally came to stare the devil in the face ourselves.
Now, after two years of sawing, we feel we have finally finished the job, and we are pleased to ship it off to you, the reader. Come to think of it: in the case of a fox, or cat, or even a toy-breed dog, the head might weigh just about the same as the book in your hands right now. Hold it in your outstretched palms, why don’t you, and close your eyes. Not so very heavy, is it? And yet from packages this small—as exurban homeowners sometimes learn, and as the Duke of Richmond discovered far too late—considerable mayhem can be unleashed.
Revue de presse

—The New York Times
 
“In this keen and exceptionally well-written book, rife with surprises, narrative suspense and a steady flow of expansive insights, ‘the world’s most diabolical virus’ conquers the unsuspecting reader’s imaginative nervous system. . . . A smart, unsettling, and strangely stirring piece of work.”
—San Francisco Chronicle
 
“Fascinating. . . . Wasik and Murphy chronicle more than two millennia of myths and discoveries about rabies and the animals that transmit it, including dogs, bats and raccoons.”
—The Wall Street Journal
 
“Rabid delivers the drama of Louis Pasteur’s courageous work developing the rabies vaccine at the same time it details the disease’s place in our cultural history, taking us from Homer to the Bronte sisters to Zora Neale Hurston to Richard Matheson. . . . All along the book’s prose and pace shine—the book is as fast as the virus is slow.”
—The Seattle Times
 
“A very readable, fascinating account of a terrifying disease….Wasik and Murphy grippingly trace the cultural history of the disease. . . . Rabid reminds us that the disease is a chilling, persistent reminder of our own animal connections, and of the simple fact that humans don’t call all of the shots.”
—The Boston Globe
 
“Compelling. . . . Murphy and Wasik give life, context and understanding to the terrifying disease. Like the virus itself, this fascinating book moves quickly, exploring both the marginalized status and deadly nature of the virus. And as the authors trace the influence of rabies through history, Rabid becomes nearly impossible to put down.”
—New Scientist
 
“An elegant exploration of the science behind one of the most horrible way to die.”
—Chris Anderson, author of The Long Tail
 
“This book is not for the squeamish. Yet those who are fascinated by how viruses attack the body, by the history of vaccination and by physicians’ efforts to save the most desperately ill patients will want to read it. There is also a happy ending: scientists are working to harness rabies as a potent drug delivery vehicle.”
—Scientific American
 
“[Wasik and Murphy] offer an in-depth look at a disease so insidious that it even turns our best friends—dogs—against us. The pair convincingly link the history of rabies…with the history of man’s fear of nature and the unknown, and our own latent capacity for beastliness.”
—The Daily Beast
 
“Thrilling, smart, and devilishly entertaining, Rabid is one of those books that changes your sense of history—and reminds us how much our human story has been shaped by the viruses that live among us.”
—Steven Johnson, author of The Ghost Map
 
“Rabies has always been as much metaphor as disease, making it an excellent subject for cultural history. . . . As Wasik and Murphy document . . . the horror of rabies has been with us since the beginning of human civilization.”
—Bookforum
 
“Funny and spry. . . . It’s a rare pleasure to read a nonfiction book by authors who research like academics but write like journalists.”

—Library Journal (starred review)
 
“Take Bill Wasik, one of our most perceptive journalistic storytellers, have him join forces with Monica Murphy, scholar of public health, and you end up with this erudite, true-life creep show of a book. It turns out that the rabies virus is a good bit more fascinating and at least as frightening as any of those blood-thirsty monsters that have stalked our fairy tales, multiplexes, and dreams.”
—Donovan Hohn, author of Moby Duck
 
“Ambitious and smart.”
—Publisher’s Weekly
 
“Terrible virus, fascinating history in Rabid.”
—NPR
 
“As entertaining as they are on rabies in culture, the authors also eruditely report on medicine and public health issues through history, from ancient Assyria to Bali to Manhattan in the last five years, showing that while the disease may be contained, it may never be fully conquered. Surprisingly fun reading about a fascinating malady.”
—Kirkus Reviews
 
“The ultimate weird dad book.”
—Very Short List
 
“The rabies virus is a microscopic particle of genes and proteins. And yet it has cast a fearful shadow over all of human history. Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy have produced an eerily elegant meditation on disease and madness, dogs and vampires. It&#39s as infectious as its subject.”
—Carl Zimmer, NPR contributor and author of Parasite Rex
 
 “A fun read, rivaling a Stephen King novel for page-turning thrills.”

Quatrième de couverture
Read it.
You&#39re already living it.
Was diabetes evolution&#39s response to the last Ice Age? Did a deadly genetic disease help our ancestors survive the bubonic plagues of Europe? Will a visit to the tanning salon help lower your cholesterol? Why do we age? Why are some people immune to HIV? Can your genes be turned on -- or off?
Joining the ranks of modern myth busters, Dr. Sharon Moalem turns our current understanding of illness on its head and challenges us to fundamentally change the way we think about our bodies, our health, and our relationship to just about every other living thing on earth, from plants and animals to insects and bacteria.
Through a fresh and engaging examination of our evolutionary history, Dr. Moalem reveals how many of the conditions that are diseases today actually gave our ancestors a leg up in the survival sweepstakes. When the option is a long life with a disease or a short one without it, evolution opts for disease almost every time.
Everything from the climate our ancestors lived in to the crops they planted and ate to their beverage of choice can be seen in our genetic inheritance. But Survival of the Sickest doesn&#39t stop there. It goes on to demonstrate just how little modern medicine really understands about human health, and offers a new way of thinking that can help all of us live longer, healthier lives.
Survival of the Sickest is filled with fascinating insights and cutting-edge research, presented in a way that is both accessible and utterly absorbing. This is a book about the interconnectedness of all life on earth -- and, especially, what that means for us.
