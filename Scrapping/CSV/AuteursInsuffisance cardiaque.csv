Forty million people in this country suffer from diagnosed cardiovascular disease, and an even larger number don’t yet know that they have a heart problem. Sixty million people have high blood pressure. Eighty million have elevated cholesterol levels. Over 1.5 million Americans have heart attacks every year. And for almost one third of them, having a heart attack was their first indication that they had a heart problem— clearly, not the best way to find out.
 
Although lifestyle factors play a major role in all of these, I was trained to treat hypertension, high levels of blood cholesterol, and coronary heart disease primarily by prescribing drugs. Yet increasing evidence indicates that medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol prevent or reverse heart disease in only a small percentage of people. These drugs sometimes make people worse. And moderate dietary changes are not enough to reverse heart disease for most people.
 
Faced with this new information, many people are beginning to wonder, “Well, why bother? There’s not much I can do to make a difference. Bring out the bacon and eggs!”
 
Fortunately, my colleagues and I are finding that the comprehensive lifestyle program described in this book can lower cholesterol and blood pressure more than has ever been reported without drugs and can even begin to reverse severe coronary heart disease in many people without using cholesterol-lowering drugs or surgery. Of course, none of us is going to live forever, but we don’t have to suffer the premature death, disability, and cost that come from heart disease.
 
I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975 when I was a medical student at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. In 1977, I had the privilege of studying with Dr. Michael DeBakey, assisting in the operating room when he performed coronary bypass surgery. His surgical skill was amazing, the technology was impressive, and the circumstances were dramatic. After a while, though, I became a little disheartened as I saw the limitations of technological approaches that literally and figuratively bypassed the underlying causes of the problem. It was the difference between temporizing and healing.
 
Bypass surgery became, for me, a metaphor for the inadequacy of treating a problem without also addressing the underlying causes. We would operate on patients, their chest pain would usually go away, and they were told that they were cured. Most would go home and continue to do the same things that led to the problem in the first place. They would smoke, eat a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, manage stress poorly, and lead sedentary lives.
 
At that time, even the hospital had several cigarette machines in the lobby, and just about the only foods available in the hospital cafeteria were cheeseburgers, fried fish, and french fries. In many hospitals, it’s still that way. Some even have McDonald’s or Burger King franchises right in the hospital. (Now, though, Baylor has a lowfat gourmet restaurant.) Several years ago, Dr. Robert Wissler, an eminent pathologist at the University of Chicago, fed his patients’ regular hospital diet to baboons. The baboons developed arterial blockages.
 
I began to wonder: What would happen if, instead of bypassing the problem, patients began to change what seemed to be the underlying causes of their heart disease?
 
I went to the medical library and began reading extensively. There were many research studies proving that diets high in fat and cholesterol cause blood cholesterol levels and blood pressure to go up, whereas low-fat, low-cholesterol diets cause blood cholesterol levels and blood pressure to go down. Epidemiological studies showed that high blood cholesterol levels increase the risk of heart disease in virtually all countries throughout the world.
 
Other studies indicated that emotional stress increases blood pressure and blood levels of cholesterol independent of diet—the type of stress is not that important. Indianapolis 500 race car drivers have higher cholesterol levels after the race than before. Tax accountants have increased cholesterol levels around April 15 when compared with the rest of the year. Medical students have higher cholesterol levels during exams. Likewise, other research studies demonstrated that stress management techniques can lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure independent of diet. Furthermore, evidence showed that smoking increased the risk of heart disease, and regular exercise helped to decrease the risk.
 
Each investigator worked in his or her own area—for example, Dr. Herbert Benson studied meditation, Dr. Ralph Paffenbarger studied exercise, Dr. Frank Sacks studied diet, and so on. Surprisingly, no one at that time had studied a comprehensive lifestyle program that used all of these lifestyle interventions, and no one had examined the effects of these lifestyle changes not only on risk factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure but also, more importantly, the effects of a comprehensive lifestyle program on the underlying heart disease process.
 
It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off between my second and third years of medical school in order to conduct a small pilot study of ten patients using this combined lifestyle program. The Chief of Medicine, Dr. Antonio Gotto, was very supportive and provided most of the testing facilities, and the Franzheim Synergy Trust provided a grant to help support the study. The Plaza Hotel in Houston donated ten rooms to us for one month.
 
One of the advantages of being a second-year medical student was that I hadn’t had enough clinical experience to be jaded, to know that it was “impossible” to reverse heart disease, so I told the patients that this program might help them get better. Since most of them had heard from their physicians that their heart disease was only likely to stabilize or worsen over time—the so-called natural history of the disease process—I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed.
 
It was hard to find eligible patients. We were looking for people who had documented coronary heart disease and chest pain but who were not going to have bypass surgery. More bypass surgery is performed in Houston than anywhere in the world, so if a patient had anigiographically documented heart disease and chest pain, then most of the time he or she underwent bypass surgery. As a result, we had to look through over ten thousand patients’ charts to find even one hundred patients who were eligible for the study.
 
Eventually, ten people volunteered. They all experienced remarkable improvements after one month on our program. People who had had incapacitating chest pain with even minimal exertion—showering, shaving, gentle sexual activity, walking short distances—became essentially pain-free and were able to do all of these activities without difficulty. In most cases, these improvements began to occur after only a few days.
 
Many of those who had been out of work for years now were able to return to work full-time. Everyone reported feeling more energy, less depression, and a greater sense of well-being.
 
The participants’ cholesterol levels dropped significantly. Their blood pressures decreased so much that we often had to reduce or even discontinue the anti-hypertensive medications that many of them had been taking for many years (and had been told they would need to take for the rest of their lives). Exercise capability improved in everyone.”
 
Most participants not only felt better, they were better. We used what was at that time a new test called an exercise thallium scan, a type of nuclear medicine study now in use in most hospitals. This test noninvasively measured how much blood flow the heart received. Using this test, we found that most patients showed significant improvements in coronary blood flow—after only thirty days!
 
This was thought by most doctors to have been impossible—“There must be some mistake,” many of them told us at the time. “The tests must be wrong.” Nuclear medicine tests such as the thallium scan were sometimes called “unclear medicine” by doctors because the images were not always 100 percent reliable—although they were accurate enough to serve as the basis for clinical decisions every day. Since the pilot study hadn’t included a randomized control group for comparison, some critics asked, “How do you know that patients wouldn’t have gotten better anyway?” even though it would have been highly unusual for anyone’s thallium scan to improve without drugs or surgery. Nevertheless, we published a summary of our results in the journal Clinical Research. A few years later, similar improvements in blood flow and function were found in studies by Dr. Gerhard Schuler in West Germany, by Dr. William Haskell at Stanford, and by Dr. Victor Froelicher in San Diego.
 
I then learned that a few physicians (including Dr. Lester Morrison, Dr. William Castelli, Dr. Walter Kempner, and others) and some laypeople such as Nathan Pritikin speculated that coronary artery blockages could be reversed in humans by a low-fat diet and exercise, whereas most cardiologists dismissed this idea as a lot of nonsense. Unfortunately, there was little scientific evidence to prove or refute these claims, so the public became confused and the medical community became polarized. Other physicians such as Dr. Robert Eliot, Dr. Carl Simonton, and Dr. Βernie Siegel and people such as Jeanne Achterberg, Joan Borysenko, and Norman Cousins discussed in their books and lectures the importance of managing emotional stress and interventions such as visualization in treating chronic diseases. Again, due to the lack of scientific proof, there were more debates, misunderstandings, and disagreements.

“Revolutionary results . . . By the standards of conventional medicine the impossible has happened. Dr. Ornish’s work could change the lives of millions.”—Newsweek

“Dr. Ornish’s research offers strong scientific evidence that lifestyle changes alone can actually reverse the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. These lifestyle changes can begin to reverse even severe coronary artery disease after only one year, without the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs.”—Claude Lenfant, M.D., director, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health

“This is more than a book on reversing heart disease; it is a powerful and wise prescription for opening the heart in its deepest sense. Dr. Ornish’s humanity, wit and integrity shine through on every page, affirming the best of what medicine has to offer. You don’t have to have heart disease to be healed through this extraordinary book and program.”—Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of Minding the Body, Mending the Mind

“In his groundbreaking book, Dr. Dean Ornish demonstrates that even severe coronary heart disease can be reversed.

I cannot recommend it highly enough.”—Bernard S. Siegel, M.D., author of Love, Medicine & Miracles

“Dr. Ornish’s book will be good news for many patients with severe coronary heart disease. As one of his earliest mentors, I am very proud of Dr. Ornish’s achievements.”—Antonio M. Gotto, Jr., M.D., president, American Heart Association (1984)

“Whether or not you think you&#39ll ever be concerned about your heart, this is likely to be the most useful book about health you&#39ll read this year, maybe ever.”—John Poppy, Esquire

“This is an epochal book. It sets a new standard in our understanding of heart disease, and it is the template against which all other books on any disease whatsoever should be judged.

First Scientific Contact with the Soul?

Science has recently discovered three startling new possibilities regarding how we think, feel, love, heal, and find meaning in our life.  This research suggests that the heart thinks, cells remember, and that both of these processes are related to an as yet mysterious, extremely powerful, but very subtle energy with properties unlike any other known force.  If the preliminary insights regarding these prospects continue to be verified, science may be taking the first tentative steps to understanding more about what shamans, kahuna, priests, spiritual leaders, and healers from ancient traditional medicines have been teaching about for centuries--the energy of the human spirit and the coded information that is the human soul.

The research and true life stories presented in this book will introduce preliminary documentation that is offering clues about the heart&#39s code, the phrase I will use throughout this book to represent a proposed subtle life or ""L"" energy ""cardio-cryptogram."" This heart&#39s code is recorded and remembered in every cell in the body as an informational template of the soul, constantly resonating within and from us, sent forth from our heart.

Toward One World Medicine

By exploring the possibility of a heart&#39s code, we may be able to begin to build a bridge between the biomechanical wonders of modern medicine, the spirituality of ancient traditional healing systems, the various alternative or complimentary medicines, and the wisdom of religious scholars and spiritual leaders.  It is not likely that we will be able to understand all the forms of medicine in the world until we are willing to broaden our understanding of the world.  By doing so, we may not have to select from among all the models of healing.  Instead, perhaps we can combine them into one world medicine made up of all the wisdom about the brain, body, energy, information, the spirit, and the soul.  With sufficient patience, tolerance, creativity, a more inclusive view of the human system as it interacts with all systems, and perhaps most of all, with a more open heart and less defensively reactive brain, we may be able to combine the rigor of science with the subtle wisdom of the heart to answer the most important questions in the universe: what and why is life?

The Burden Of Prudence

The hypotheses regarding the heart&#39s code are without doubt among the boldest proposals any scientist could make.  I offer them to facilitate more discussion and study and as new possibilities to be explored as medicine experiences its growing pains associated with the challenges in dealing with the issues of spirituality and mortality, which are of such deep concern to patients, and the lessons of so-called alternative or complementary medicines.  These are proposals that many of my scientific colleagues often say they ""have a very hard time accepting."" Surgeon Dr.  Bernie Siegel is the well-known author of Love, Medicine and Miracles and other books that deal with ideas about mind/body/soul interactions that many of his colleagues still refuse to accept, get angry with, and often consider strange and even crazy.  He writes, ""What disturbs me is the use of the word &#39accept.&#39 If we close our minds and don&#39t accept, science and healing cannot move forward.  Instead of &#39hard to accept,&#39 let us say, &#39hard to understand.&#39""

Using our current scientific way of thinking, it is very difficult to understand how the heart could have a code, a cell could have a memory, and an immeasurable form of energy could contain information about the soul.  I suggest that we should study these ideas precisely because they are ""non-sense."" They do not make sense in terms of science&#39s current ways of trying to explain the mysteries of life.  Perhaps these new possibilities regarding the heart&#39s code will offer some new ways to come to our senses about the meaning of life and the processes of healing.

In the mid-1800s, the idea that tiny germs invisible to the eye could make us sick was seen as ""utter nonsense"" by the medical leaders of that time.  Based on seemingly strange but recurring reports from patients and some doctors and nurses about the suffering that seemed to be caused by dirty hands delivering babies, and thousands of needless deaths caused by the use of scalpels still defiantly sharpened on the bottom of the surgeon&#39s boot to show disdain for the silly ""germ theory,"" doctors began to reluctantly accept the possibility of the existence of imperceptible but deadly microorganisms.  This doubting acceptance allowed the development of more understanding about invisible things causing visible consequences, and doctors began to wash their hands and sterilize their instruments before any medical procedure.  Today, because of the historical prudence of their predecessors, the burden of proof has been met and doctors understand much more--but not all--about bacteria.  This same cautious but accepting prudence is required if we are to learn more about the existence of a heart&#39s code and the cellular memories it conveys.

Four Hypotheses Regarding Energy, Information, and the Mind/Body Connection

Our understanding of the heart as a sentient organ is about where our understanding of the miraculous complexities of the brain was more than one hundred years ago.  In comparison to the continuing rapid progress in study of the brain, learning about the heart as more than just a pump is developing much more slowly.  The central hypotheses regarding information-containing energy communicated by the heart were initially proposed by Drs.  Gary E.  Schwartz and Linda G.  Russek.  They are as clearly stated and testable as any other set of scientific suppositions, but the ideas of a ""thinking"" heart and information-carrying energy seem excessively difficult for many scientists to accept as starting points for study.

Dr.  Gary Schwartz is a professor of Psychology, Neurology, and Psychiatry and director of the Human Energy Systems Laboratory at the University of Arizona.  His associate, Dr.  Linda Russek, is a research psychologist at the Harvard University Student Health Service and codirector of the Human Energy Systems Laboratory.  They are a creative, energetic, sensitive research team who have always been interested in a ""systems"" or interactive view of how life works.  They have dedicated their professional lives to the attempt to create one medicine out of the many diverse approaches to healing and have never been afraid to challenge and extend the accepted principles of psychology and medicine.  They have combined the fields of biology, the new physics that studies subtle energy and the invisible atomic world, and modern cardiology to help explain the info-energetic nature of the heart beyond what skeptics call the abiding impulse to mythologize the heart.  They based their field of energy cardiology on what they call ""dynamic systems memory theory,"" the idea that all systems are constantly exchanging mutually influential energy, which contains information that alters the systems taking part in the exchange.  They offer four hypotheses to explain how cells might be able to make memories out of the info-energy constantly circulated through the body system by the heart.  I have paraphrased and expanded their hypotheses here.  

1. Energy and information are the same thing.  Everything that exists has energy, energy is full of information, and stored info-energy is what makes up cellular memories. Based on theories and research from the field of biology and other sciences, all living systems are by their nature manifestations of energy that contains the information (memory) of what they are and how they function.  To scientists, the word ""system"" refers to a set of interactions between inseparable units.  From the interactions between the tiniest parts within a single cell to the exchange of information between family members at dinner to the energy bouncing back and forth between the stars and planets, everything exists in a continuous info-energetic relationship.  Since all systems are information-containing energy ""stuff,"" all systems constantly exchange memories.  

2.  What we call mind, consciousness, or our intentions are really manifestations of information-containing energy. Based on the lessons learned from modern physics, information and mind seem to be one and the same.  What I am calling ""L"" energy is the basic code of life and what our ""system"" remembers as ""who"" we are.  Energy is the ability to do work and a force that conveys our personal life code (our systemic memory) along with the information it contains.  Information is what gives a system its form and structure, and energy is the force or function that moves a system, connects all aspects of a system, and helps systems communicate and connect.  Since all systems are connected and share forms of the same energy, all systems share common memories.  

3.  The heart is the primary generator of info-energy. The heart is constantly sending out patterns of info-energy that regulate organs and cells throughout the body.  Every cell in the body is literally bathed in the info-energy conducted from and by the heart.  Since the heart is a primary generator and transmitter of info-energy, it is central to our system&#39s recollection of its life--its cellular memory.  

4.  Because we are manifestations of the info-energy coming to, flowing within, and constantly being sent out from our total cellular system, who and how we are is a physical representation of a recovered set of cellular memories.  Based on cellular biology, we know that certain molecules have very good memories because they are particularly good at storing complex coded information.  For example, DNA is a nucleic acid found in all cell nuclei that contains genetic information that determines to a yet to be determined extent not only how we look but what diseases we might develop, whether or not we are grouchy or cheerful in temperament, and even how long we live.  All cells have energy, so all cells contain and share information.  All cells store info-energetic memories, and our heart, by nature of its immense power, millions of cells throbbing in unison, and central location in our body, is the central organ that constantly pulsates info-energy from, between, and to all other organs and cells.  Because of the heart&#39s code and the cellular memories with which it deals, every cell in our body becomes a holographic or complete representation of our energetic heart.  It may take extraordinary individuals such as the little girl above and the other heart transplant recipients you will read about, or at least individuals willing to learn to employ the abilities all of us have, to be able to make our implicit cellular memories explicit.  If any one of us can do it, than any of us also has the potential to be a cellular memory recoverer.




Two Intelligences

Two centuries ago when science and its methods for looking for meaning emerged, an artificial choice was thrust upon us when scientific inquiry and religious faith began to come into conflict.  Although Einstein warned us that science without religion is blind and religion without science is lame, we have often assumed that we had to chose between science&#39s ""hard logic"" and religion&#39s ""blind faith.""

Historian Sidney Mead writes, ""Americans since 1800 have, in effect, been given the hard choice between being intelligent according to the prevailing stands in their intellectual centers or being religious according to the standards prevalent in the denominations."" More recently, this choice as to the way to find meaning in life has been played out in the often heated conflict between biomedicine and alternative medicines, between ""objective"" science and ancient healing systems, between rational atheism and the irrational preachings of blind faith from a religious denomination that sees itself as the only ""right way"" to salvation.  Beginning to understand how the heart may be where the soul speaks may provide a middle ground and the establishment of a creatively tolerant meeting place for those who come from within the powerful system of the scientific method and the wisdom of the heart embraced by so many indigenous people.

We don&#39t have to and should not give up our quest to learn more about the remarkable brain and our respect for its magnificent powers of reason in order to begin to learn more about the untapped spiritual info-energetic wisdom of the heart.  An irrational world brings us only misery, but a millennium in which the gifted brain is moderated and instructed by a gentle heart could bring us a shared paradise on earth.  If we are willing to try to combine the best the brain has created, and will create, with the wisdom of the heart&#39s code that may be our soul calling out the cellular memories that give meaning to these creations, we can become much smarter than we have ever been.  We can have two major intelligences and learn to adore the rational skepticism of science and still look for the energy of the soul conveyed by the heart.  This is an objective of this book.

Sources of Support

The ideas about the role of the heart that I present here come primarily from four sources.  The first is the collection of my own personal and professional experiences that seem to illustrate and document several points about the heart&#39s code.  While I have been as careful as possible to be objective in my presentation of clinical materials obtained in my professional clinical work, what I consider to be my own lingering cellular memories of my ordeal with cancer render my personal accounts of my experiences highly subjective.  When I seem excessively optimistic about the existence of the heart&#39s code and overly defensive in my attempt to describe and document it, it is because I believe it is what I became so familiar with when I almost died.  It is my hope, however, that my own story and the stories from other patients will connect with some of your own experiences so that the issues raised in this book will seem more worthy of your prolonged attention through some of the unusual and sometimes disconcerting material ahead.

A second source of support for the ideas presented here derives from the lessons from indigenous peoples who are often more comfortable and tuned in to the less blatant lessons of life and who are often very ""L"" energy sensitive.  Based on their own form of equally important science, these lessons provide unique ways of forming new questions that may help us understand more about the heart&#39s code.

A third source of support for the heart&#39s code comes from stories from heart transplant recipients who provide unique insights into the workings of the heart.  A small percentage of these patients seem, like the indigenous people, to be extremely ""cardio-sensitive"" to their ""L"" energy and cellular memories.  Like the little girl who helped catch her heart donor&#39s murderer, they are able to produce very accurate accounts of changes in their personalities that correspond with the personality and memories of a donor about whom they would seem to have no way to know anything.  As with my own story, I do not offer these accounts as proof of the existence of a heart&#39s code or cellular memories but as clinical evidence that much more is going on in transplantation that all of us may learn from whether or not we have a new heart placed in our chests.

The fourth source of support comes from the theories and research of scientists contributing to energy cardiology and cardio-energetics, the many new fields of scientific inquiry that deal in different ways and to varying degrees with concepts related to the idea that energy and information are one in the same.  You will read about research at major centers by highly respected scientists who are offering strong hints regarding the possibility of ""L"" energy and the heart&#39s code and about what physicians and nurses have to say about a thinking heart.

By combining aspects of all of the above sources of support for the possibility of the existence of a heart&#39s code, you can make your own judgment as to whether further study of its existence is merited, and you can chose whether or not to be alert for what your heart has to say about the way you live, work, and love.
Revue de presse
""This is a marvelous piece of work . . . fascinating, eye-opening, and practical.  Love and health are intimately related and the evidence is well documented.  Read it and start living a heart healthy life.""
--Bernie Siegel, M.D., author of Love, Medicine & Miracles

""Paul Pearsall&#39s long-awaited book is brilliant, heart-opening, and enthralling. Interweaving his personal health story--a life-saving immune system transplant--with his work as a well-credentialed psychologist studying heart transplant patients, Dr. Pearsall makes an astoundingly strong case for the underrated heart as the seat of the mind and altruistic soul.""
--Candace Pert, Ph.D., author of Molecules of Emotion
