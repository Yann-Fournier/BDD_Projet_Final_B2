Ilan Pappe,"&#39A major intervention in an argument that will, and must, continue. There&#39s no hope of lasting Middle East peace while the ghosts of 1948 still walk.&#39 ― Independent

&#39Along with the late Edward Said, Ilan Pappe is the most eloquent writer of Palestinian history.&#39 ― New Statesman

&#39Pappe has opened up an important new line of inquiry into the vast and fateful subject of the Palestinian refugees. His book is rewarding in other ways. It has at times an elegiac, even sentimental, character, recalling the lost, obliterated life of the Palestinian Arabs and imagining or regretting what Pappe believes could have been a better land of Palestine.&#39 ― Times Literary Supplement

&#39Ilan Pappe is Israel&#39s bravest, most principled, most incisive historian.&#39 ― John Pilger - director of The War on Democracy and author of Freedom Next Time

&#39Superb account of how, and why, Palestinians were driven out of their homes.&#39 ― Socialist Review

&#39Pappe’s book is an essential read for anyone trying to understand the politics and history of the Middle East.&#39 ― Frontline Magazine (an Independent Marxist review from Scotland)

&#39Leading Israeli historian Ilan Pappe delves into his country&#39s bloodied past in search of answers in the present.&#39 ― Morning Star

&#39Pappe is one of the brave few voices to stand up and be counted in the oppressive atmosphere of Israeli society. Pappe&#39s book is a searing account of the horrific brutality perpetrated during the birth of the state of Israel.&#39 ― Morning Star

&#39Pappe is well positioned to lob a grenade such as this one into the twin worlds of Middle Eastern studies and politics. Pappe&#39s book should shock and shame the academic world&#39 ― Arab Banker

&#39Pappe&#39s ethical clarity and humane vision permeate The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine... Given the meticulous research and compelling moral imperative embodied in The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, Zionism itself may be in trouble.&#39 ― Race and Class

&#39Pappe offers a scorching indictment of Israel&#39s treatment of the Palestinian people in The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine.&#39 ― Metro

&#39A bold expose of Israel&#39s purge of its Arab population in the early years of its existence. It should be read by anyone wanting to grasp the seemingly unfathomable background to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Pappe himself should be supported and applauded.&#39 ― Morning Star

&#39Ilan Pappe&#39s The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine is a vital contribution to the scholarship from these new historians… Pappe forever puts to rest any doubt that Palestinians were systematically and brutally expelled from their homeland.&#39 ― Against the Current (An independent socialist organisation)

&#39Pappe’s book will command attention.&#39 ― Washington Report on Middle East Affairs

&#39Superb account of how, and why, Palestinians were driven out of their homes. Pappe explains why there can be no peace until this crime has been acknowledged and redressed.&#39 ― Scottish Review

&#39The organization of the material in this book leaves almost nothing to be desired. The twelve sections substantially challenge and considerably undermine the ostensibly convincing Israeli discourse on the refugees question and the 1984 events.&#39 ― Arab Studies Quarterly

&#39Shocking, telling and illuminating.&#39 ― Emel

&#39Groundbreaking research into a well-kept Israeli secret. A classic of historical scholarship on a taboo subject by one of Israel&#39s foremost New Historians.&#39 ― Ghada Karmi - Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, University of Exeter, England, UK",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Bill Maher,"""For fans, the book is a welcome reminder of Maher’s funniness, his intelligence, his sanity....Maher’s observations are often as cutting as they’re well-written [and] come from a place of wit and education and work well bundled together as a book.""—New York Post

""Maher’s style...is funny but not hyperbolic, challenging but not confrontational, and urgent but not in your face. That formula has served Maher well throughout his career, and it serves him well in this book.""—Booklist

""His wittiest and most incisive book yet...he writes sharp critiques on American life, politics, and culture. From covering free speech and cancel culture to race and religion, Maher manages to dissect the most controversial of topics in a way that is both funny and digestible.""—Air Mail

“The least boring book I’ve ever read.”—John Cleese

“This book is so funny you may not notice how smart it is. The only thing that will make you want to put it down is to take a moment to tell someone else about it.”—Donna Brazile

“I love Bill Maher. He’s often brilliant, occasionally maddening but unfailingly original. He’s the unfiltered, hilarious voice we desperately need during these batshit-crazy times.”—Katie Couric

“Whether you agree or disagree with him—and I do both—Bill Maher had proven himself to be an illuminating force in a world that values heat over light. His is a vital voice, keeping the left honest and calling the right to account for itself before the bar of reason and of decency. I’d say ‘thank God for Bill,’ but he doesn’t believe in God. So I’ll just say thanks.”—Jon Meacham",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

&#39Her book is lifted...into the rare company of those that linger in the mind long after dramas, sagas and sophisticated frolics have coalesced into a blur of half-forgotten fiction&#39 ― Bookman

&#39There is humour as well as tragedy in this book, besides its faint note of hope for human nature; and it is delightfully written in the now familiar Southern tradition&#39 ― Sunday Times

Cyril Kamar,"L&#39histoire de Cyril Kamar (alias K-Maro) commence dans les années 1980. D&#39une enfance marquée par la guerre du Liban – pays où il est né – aux années 1990, quand sa famille émigre à Montréal, Cyril Kamar a toujours vécu entouré de musique. D&#39abord bercé par la chanson française, c&#39est au Canada qu&#39il découvre le hip-hop. Il se forge très tôt une solide réputation dans le milieu de l&#39underground montréalais après avoir remporté plusieurs concours de Freestyle. Dès l&#39âge de 17 ans, il fonde sa maison de production, mêlant création et management. Pendant plusieurs années, il fréquente – entre Montréal et New York – des breakers, graffeurs, DJs et apprend peu à peu ce qui deviendra sa marque de fabrique : un équilibre entre le sens des affaires et l&#39audace artistique.

En 2004, son label Kpone Inc. Music Group connaît un succès international. L&#39album La good Life se vend à des millions d&#39exemplaires dans le monde. Propulsé par le hit "" Femme Like U "" devenu culte aujourd&#39hui, il se hisse en tête des Charts dans plus de dix-huit pays.
Après une tournée éprouvante à guichet fermé, Cyril Kamar ressent le besoin de s&#39éloigner de la frénésie médiatique. Il se consacre au développement d&#39une toute jeune artiste qu&#39il a repérée et qui est encore méconnue du grand public : Shy&#39m.
En quelques années, Shy&#39m devient l&#39une des artistes françaises les plus influentes de son époque, avec plus de deux millions d&#39albums vendus.

Au fil des années, il est amené à travailler avec de nombreux talents tels que Corneille, Fredz, Belly, Vai, 411, Suzuya, Ogee, Skip The Use, Bruno Mars, P,Diddy, Dipset, Cheb Mami, et conseille les plus grandes maisons de disques tel que Warner Music ou encore Universal sur leur stratégie. De même, il est régulièrement sollicité pour partager son savoir-faire auprès d&#39entreprises du secteur du luxe ou de grandes écoles comme HEC Paris.

Amateur et collectionneur d&#39art contemporain, porté par un passé où les différents domaines artistiques se mêlaient, Cyril Kamar œuvre également depuis plusieurs années auprès de jeunes artistes peintres ou de jeunes galeristes pour les aider dans la vison et la structuration de leur business. Accompagné par son épouse et partenaire Anne Sophie Mignaux Kamar, ils décident en 2023 de fonder la Maison Kel Akai, une maison qui se consacrera à l&#39accompagnement et à la valorisation des œuvres et des talents. Particularité de cette galerie, unique en son genre : les artistes seront conseillés par un entrepreneur qui est lui-même artiste, Cyril Kamar.

Musique, art, philanthropie, entreprenariat, Cyril Kamar est donc – à 43 ans – devenu ce qu&#39il a toujours rêvé d&#39être : un marchand d&#39ART(S).",
Romain Gary,"Romain Gary, né Roman Kacew à Vilnius en 1914, est élevé par sa mère qui place en lui de grandes espérances, comme il le racontera dans La promesse de l&#39aube.

Après des études de droit, il s&#39engage dans l&#39aviation et rejoint le général de Gaulle en 1940. Son premier roman, Éducation européenne, paraît avec succès en 1945 et révèle un grand conteur au style rude et poétique. La même année, il entre au Quai d&#39Orsay. Grâce à son métier de diplomate, il séjourne à Sofia, New York, Los Angeles, La Paz. En 1948, il publie Le grand vestiaire, et reçoit le prix Goncourt en 1956 pour Les racines du ciel. Consul à Los Angeles, il quitte la diplomatie en 1960, écrit Les oiseaux vont mourir au Pérou (Gloire à nos illustres pionniers) et épouse l&#39actrice Jean Seberg en 1963. Il fait paraître un roman humoristique, Lady L., se lance dans de vastes sagas : La comédie américaine et Frère Océan, rédige des scénarios et réalise deux films. Peu à peu les romans de Gary laissent percer son angoisse du déclin et de la vieillesse : Au-delà de cette limite votre ticket n&#39est plus valable, Clair de femme. Jean Seberg se donne la mort en 1979. En 1980, Romain Gary fait paraître son dernier roman, Les cerfs-volants, avant de se suicider à Paris en décembre.

Quatrième de couverture
SHORTLISTED FOR THE BAILEY&#39S WOMEN&#39S PRIZE FOR FICTION 2014.

From the award-winning author of &#39Half of a Yellow Sun,&#39 a powerful story of love, race and identity.

As teenagers in Lagos, Ifemelu and Obinze fall in love. Their Nigeria is under military dictatorship, and people are fleeing the country if they can. The self-assured Ifemelu departs for America. There she suffers defeats and triumphs, finds and loses relationships, all the while feeling the weight of something she never thought of back home: race. Obinze had hoped to join her, but post-9/11 America will not let him in, and he plunges into a dangerous, undocumented life in London.

Thirteen years later, Obinze is a wealthy man in a newly democratic Nigeria, while Ifemelu has achieved success as a blogger. But after so long apart and so many changes, will they find the courage to meet again, face to face?

Fearless, gripping, spanning three continents and numerous lives, the National Book Critics Circle Award-winning &#39Americanah&#39 is a richly told story of love and expectation set in today&#39s globalized world.

HELL YES. This is one of those books that has the potential to change things – a monumental piece of research -- Caitlin Moran

Revelatory, frightening, hopeful. A secular Bible -- Jeanette Winterson

This book is a devastating indictment of institutionalised complacency and a rallying cry to fight back… Invisible Women should propel women into action. It should also be compulsory reading for men -- Christina Patterson ― Sunday Times

Invisible Women takes on the neglected topic of what we don&#39t know - and why. The result is a powerful, important and eye-opening analysis of the gender politics of knowledge and ignorance. With examples from technology to natural disasters, this is an original and timely reminder of why we need women in the leadership of the institutions that shape every aspect of our lives. -- Cordelia Fine

« L&#39immigration est une chance pour la France. »

Voilà ce que l&#39on nous répète en boucle, depuis des décennies. Chirac, Sarkozy, Hollande et Macron ont tous prononcé cette phrase. Et si on vérifiait ?

Laurent Obertone l&#39a fait. Pulvérisant le plus grand des tabous français, il révèle les chiffres de l&#39immigration, tous les chiffres, en détaille les causes, l&#39ampleur, l&#39évolution, et les conséquences.

‘Friends who couldn’t get enough of Sally Rooney’s Conversations with Friends will fall head over heels for Coco Mellor’s debut novel’ ES Magazine
‘Cleopatra and Frankenstein, the luminous debut novel from Coco Mellors, is a book about many things: It&#39s a great, swooning love story; a shattering depiction of how addiction and mental illness warp our lives; and a perceptive, witty portrait of globalized New York. But most of all, Mellors has written a devastatingly human book, at turns sharp and tender, that marks her as the rare writer whose sentences are as beautiful as they are wise. An unforgettable read’ Sam Lansky, author of The Gilded Razor and Broken People
‘A character driven epic thoroughly engrossing and entirely magnificent. It is thrilling to read a book that articles with nuance and compassion the way gender impacts every part of our lives. Sometimes you can just tell that a debut novel has been percolating and perfecting inside an author&#39s mind until it is ready to leap into-and ultimately change-the world’ Adam Eli, author of The Queer Conscience
“Mellors’ remarkably assured and sensitive debut … strongly evoke[s] Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life… At its core, it’s a novel about how love and lovers are easily misinterpreted and how romantic troubles affect friends and family. A canny and engrossing rewiring of the big-city romance.”―Kirkus Reviews, starred review

Michelle Zauner,"From the indie rock star Japanese Breakfast, an unflinching, powerful, deeply moving memoir about growing up mixed-race, Korean food, losing her Korean mother, and forging her own identity.

In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humour and heart, she tells of growing up the only Asian-American kid at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother’s particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother’s tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the east coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, performing gigs with her fledgling band – and meeting the man who would become her husband – her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother’s diagnosis of terminal pancreatic cancer when Michelle was twenty-five that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her.

Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Michelle Zauner’s voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/mea2gb1n1q72lpsta6246340n7._SY600_.jpg
Gary Stevenson,"Revue de presse
Compelling, intensely readable, unsettling. An unforgettable story of greed, financial madness and moral decay. -- Rory Stewart

An incredibly important and timely book, very much of its era. The Wolf of Wall Street with a moral compass, it lays bare the spiritual vacuity of the systems and processes that both dominate and reduce our humanity. -- Irvine Welsh

Astonishing, enraging, extremely funny and exquisitely sad - a magnificent exposé of the &#39masters of the universe&#39 whose greed imperils us all. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. -- The Secret Barrister

The Trading Game is the best finance memoir I’ve ever read. Gary Stevenson&#39s tale of plundering Wall Street like some kind of cockney pirate is by turn hilarious and harrowing. A thrilling read that raises profound questions about who runs the global financial system. -- Zeke Faux, author of Number Go Up

A well written and often darkly funny book that makes a convincing case that high finance is as toxic, reckless and deeply cynical as ever. ― Guardian

The Trading Game is Stevenson’s account ― his confession ― of how he achieved this dream, becoming Citibank’s most profitable trader, and how it made him angry, dejected and ill. There are parallels with Liar’s Poker by Michael Lewis, an autobiographical account of a young man’s adventures in the financial markets… This dark but profitable vision is lightened by moments of comic self-importance. ― The Times

Stevenson is a sharp observer, with a gift for colourful if merciless description… His breakdown started with trading mania and ended with his exile to the Tokyo office, pleading to be allowed to leave. His bonuses had brought him torment, not freedom. ― Financial Times

For a self-proclaimed mathematics nerd, Stevenson is a fine wordsmith. His greatest strength is his ability to unravel complex concepts… Stevenson candidly shares his traumas and experiences… finance, for all its allure and excess, is a world where excess comes at a cost, a cost not measured in dollars but in the essence of who we become. ― Daily Telegraph

As a critique of the monstrous modern evolutions of finance, Gary Stevenson’s account of the frenzy and follies of trading “trillions a day” on behalf of the US giant Citibank is powerful… Rude and funny… demotic fast-paced prose... he tells a vivid story and invites us to make our own judgement. ― TLS

Gary Stevenson’s rags-to-riches memoir exposes a system where the rich can’t lose and the economy is choked by inequality.… Stevenson brings alive the unease of trying to survive in the purgatorial space between being an employee and an outsider… ― New Statesman

*An outrageous, white-knuckle journey to the dark heart of an intoxicating world - from someone who survived the trading game and then blew it all wide open*

&#39If you were gonna rob a bank, and you saw the vault door there, left open, what would you do? Would you wait around?

Ever since he was a kid, kicking broken footballs on the streets of East London in the shadow of Canary Wharf&#39s skyscrapers, Gary wanted something better. Something a whole lot bigger.

Then he won a competition run by a bank: &#39The Trading Game&#39. The prize: a golden ticket to a new life, as the youngest trader in the whole city. A place where you could make more money than you&#39d ever imagined. Where your colleagues are dysfunctional maths geniuses, overfed public schoolboys and borderline psychopaths, yet they start to feel like family. Where soon you&#39re the bank&#39s most profitable trader, dealing in nearly a trillion dollars. A day. Where you dream of numbers in your sleep - and then stop sleeping at all.

But what happens when winning starts to feel like losing? When the easiest way to make money is to bet on millions becoming poorer and poorer - and, as the economy starts slipping off a precipice, your own sanity starts slipping with it? You want to stop, but you can&#39t. Because nobody ever leaves.

Would you stick, or quit? Even if it meant risking everything?

Toni Morrison,"Revue de presse
Not only a story but an awe-inspiring poem that confronts beauty itself. ― Guardian

So charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry ― New York Times

I imagine if our greatest American novelist, William Faulkner, were alive today he would herald Toni Morrison&#39s emergence as a kindred spirit... Discovering a writer like Toni Morrison is the rarest of pleasures ― Washington Post

The Bluest Eye is a fine book, a lament for all starved and stunted children everywhere ― Daily Telegraph

Morrison&#39s style rivets the reader...her synaesthetic, often rhythmic, even chanting prose recalls both Faulkner and Emily Dickinson ― The Times Literary Supplement
Quatrième de couverture
Unlovely and unloved, Pecola prays each night for blue eyes like those of her privileged white schoolfellows. At once intimate and expansive, unsparing in its truth-telling, The Bluest Eye shows how the past savagely defines the present. A powerful examination of our obsession with beauty and conformity, Toni Morrison’s virtuosic first novel asks powerful questions about race, class, and gender with the subtlety and grace that have always characterised her writing.

Race, Anti-racism, and Neoracism

For most of my life, I saw my mother as neither black nor white. Her Puerto Rican father was darker-skinned than me and her Puerto Rican mother was as light-skinned as any white American I knew. My mother emerged a perfect blend of the two: a light-brown hue that suggested neither blackness nor whiteness-at least not to my mind. Nor did I view her as ""Hispanic,"" a word she hated due to its association with Spanish conquest, or even as ""Latina""-though she would certainly have checked that box on a census.

She would sometimes describe herself as ""of color."" But whenever she really cared to show her identity, she would say she was Puerto Rican, and more specifically NewYorican-a person who grew up in one of the Puerto Rican enclaves of New York City. Just as important, she would say that she was from the Bronx, and more specifically the South Bronx. Had you asked me what ""race"" my mother belonged to as a child or adolescent, that would have been my long-winded answer: she was a Puerto Rican/NewYorican from the South Bronx. The words ""black"" and ""white"" would not have even occurred to me.

My mother died of cancer when I was eighteen. In the wake of her passing, I took every opportunity to talk about her with anyone who remembered her. I was surprised one time to hear a friend of mine describe her simply as ""a black woman."" ""You saw my mom as black?"" I asked him. ""Well, sure. She was, wasn&#39t she?"" I had never considered that the outside world might have perceived her differently. In the case of my friend, I wrote this off as a misperception born of not knowing her very well.

So it came as an even greater shock when my father, who knew her as well as anyone, agreed with my friend. ""Your mother was a black woman,"" he told me years after she died. I was shocked. I had never seen her as black and I never heard her describe herself that way. I had seen her as an immigrant outside the American black-white binary. Yet many people saw her simply as a light-skinned black American woman.

I am tempted to insist that my memory of her identity is accurate, and that others&#39 perceptions of her are simply mistaken. But what would it even mean for their perceptions to be ""mistaken""? What does it mean to belong to one race or another? Is it a matter of scientific fact, self-identification, perception by others, cultural background, or arbitrary social convention?

What Is Race?

I&#39ve been using the word ""race"" without defining it. Indeed, most of us use it all the time without thinking about what it is. Yet we are constantly arguing about it. For a moment, forget that you ever learned the word ""race."" Let&#39s begin at the most basic level.

The Concept of Race

We humans use concepts to make sense of the world. Some concepts are natural and others are socially constructed.

In science, for instance, our goal is to describe nature. So we develop concepts and categories that map onto nature as closely as possible, such as the concept of a tree or the concept of mass in physics. These are natural concepts-concepts that map onto nature with great precision. If for some reason these concepts disappeared from our minds, we&#39d be forced by logic and our senses to reinvent them in much the same way. Natural concepts carve reality at the joints.

Other times, our goal is not to describe nature but to create a desirable outcome in society. For example, if we&#39re trying to count time, we may invent the concept of a week-a unit of time that&#39s equal to the sun rising and setting seven times-so that everyone can be on the same page about when to do things.

The seven-day week doesn&#39t exist in nature. We could&#39ve decided that a week equals six days or eight days. Or we could have no weeks at all-counting time only by days. We invented the concept of a week to achieve an important goal: ease of coordination with others. And if our minds were suddenly wiped clean of the concept of a week, we might not reinvent it in exactly the same way. This concept, in other words, is a social construct.

The concept of race falls into a third category. It&#39s neither completely natural nor completely socially constructed. It&#39s a social construct inspired by a natural phenomenon.

To take a simple example, consider the concept of a month. Months don&#39t exist in nature; they don&#39t track anything in the natural world. Nothing in the cosmos begins when February does or ends when March does. We could just as easily end March a day later and give April an extra day. Or we could get rid of March altogether and distribute its days among the remaining eleven months.

On the other hand, months are clearly inspired by something that does exist in nature: the lunar cycle. It is no accident that months are similar in length to the lunar cycle, which averages 29.5 days. (The words ""moon"" and ""month"" even derive from the same root.) So what is a month? It&#39s not a natural phenomenon because it doesn&#39t track anything in the natural world with precision. Therefore, it must be a social construct. Yet unlike most social constructs, it owes its very existence and basic characteristics to a natural phenomenon. It is thus a kind of hybrid: a social construct inspired by a natural phenomenon.

The concept of race is similar to the concept of a month. It too is a social construct inspired by a natural phenomenon. What natural phenomenon is the concept of race inspired by?

Tens of thousands of years ago, several large populations of humans migrated out of Africa, where all humans first evolved (Africans, of course, remained in Africa). Once out of Africa, these populations remained isolated from one another-separated by mountains, oceans, or great distances. As a result of living and reproducing in unique environments for tens of thousands of years, each group&#39s gene pool evolved in response to the unique selection pressures of its environment.

The legacy of these genetic differences is still visible and measurable today. Although each of us is genetically unique (barring identical twins), each of us also belongs to clusters of similar genomes whose similarity stems from the major out-of-Africa migrations that occurred tens of thousands of years ago. These clusters are not sharply separated from one another. They overlap a great deal, and therefore the boundaries between them are blurry. Using standard statistical tools, the strength of these genome clusters can be measured. The visible correlates of these genetically similar clusters are the underlying natural phenomena that inspired the concept of race. (See Appendix A for more details.)

But as with the concept of a month, the social construct has been untethered from the natural phenomenon that inspired it. If tomorrow astronomers discovered that the lunar cycle was really 35 days instead of 29.5, that discovery would have no bearing at all on the length of a calendar month. Likewise, whatever population geneticists discover about the clustering of similar genomes-for instance, if they were to discover something that completely upends our current understanding of population genetics-that would have no bearing on the concept of race that we use socially and in public policy. The social construct of race has flown the perch of the natural phenomenon that inspired it.

The Arbitrariness of Race

As we will see in chapter three, many of today&#39s anti-racists are adamant on implementing race-based policies throughout every sector of society. One problem with this approach is that it&#39s impossible to draw neat lines between races. And the lines that we end up drawing are not based on science nor reason but on a variety of absurd factors. President Barack Obama is the son of a white mother and a black father, so we categorize Obama as black. But why? His parentage is equal parts ""black"" and ""white,"" so on what basis do we categorize him as black rather than white or mixed? The answer, it seems, is that American culture still observes the old ""one-drop rule""-whereby anyone with one drop of ""black blood"" is considered fully black. In other words, we choose to delineate race using an arbitrary rule that was originally developed to uphold racial apartheid.

Similarly, our society decided how to answer the question ""Who is Asian?"" during the Chinese Exclusion Act-a racist law that existed to define a group of people to exclude. Decades later, the Eisenhower administration needed to come up with race categories to implement its policies and decided on a perfunctory list. But it was the Carter administration that finally decided on the canonical list of five categories we use today: Black, Hispanic, White, Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American/Alaska Native.

Population geneticists were not consulted to help create these categories (nor could they have spoken with real authority prior to the sequencing of the genome). These categories were created based upon a vague mix of intuitions about racial difference and political lobbyists attempting to sway the categorization in one direction or another. To qualify for certain government programs, for instance, someone needs to have one-fourth Native American ancestry. Why one-fourth? Why not one-half? Why not one-eighth? Why not one-sixteenth? The answer is that administering social programs requires drawing sharp lines that don&#39t exist in nature, so they simply decided to draw it at the one-fourth mark.

The Asian American category includes people from India and Pakistan but not from Afghanistan. Again, the reason has nothing to do with science and everything to do with the race-based social policy that could not be administered without a crisp definition of who fits into which race.

Think likewise of the Hispanic category. ""Hispanic"" describes anyone with ancestry from a Spanish-speaking country, but sometimes it&#39s treated as a race, other times as an ethnicity. You can be categorized as either black Hispanic or white Hispanic, but for many practical purposes (for college admissions, say) either designation qualifies as a preferred racial category. In some cases, Spanish Europeans and Indigenous Peruvians are considered in the same category, because they&#39re both from Spanish-speaking nations. Yet Brazilians are also sometimes counted as Hispanic. It is also worth noting that unlike ""black"" and ""white,"" ""Hispanic"" and ""Asian"" are not terms that belonged to the self-concept of the people in those categories when they were created. Few Hispanic people understood themselves to be ""Hispanic"" when the term was first widely used in the 1970s. A recent survey found that only 30 percent of ""Asian Americans"" thought of themselves as ""Asian."" Most thought of themselves as belonging to a specific ethnic group, such as ""Korean"" or ""Pakistani.""

David E. Bernstein describes a case that illustrates the arbitrariness of using race categories to distribute social benefits:

Christine Combs and Steve Lynn applied to the Small Business Administration (SBA) to have their respective businesses certified as Hispanic-owned and therefore eligible for minority business enterprise preferences. Combs&#39s maternal grandparents were born in Spain, she grew up in a bilingual family, was fluent in Spanish, and acted as an interpreter for Mexican and Spanish customers. Lynn&#39s sole claim to Hispanic status was that he was a Sephardic Jew whose ancestors had fled Spain centuries earlier.

The SBA ultimately decided that Lynn qualified as Hispanic, but Combs did not. Combs&#39s SBA hearing officer declared that Combs could not claim Hispanic status . . . because she presented no evidence that she had faced discrimination because she is Hispanic. The officer noted that neither Combs&#39s maiden name nor her married name was recognizably Spanish, and her blond hair and blue eyes did not give her a noticeably Hispanic appearance. On appeal, a judge found that the hearing officer had ""reason to question Ms. Combs&#39 status as a Hispanic."" The judge therefore upheld the denial of Combs&#39s petition.

An SBA hearing officer also initially denied Lynn&#39s claim to Hispanic status because Lynn had not shown that he had been discriminated against as a Hispanic. But when Lynn appealed, the judge noted that the underlying law defined Hispanic as including anyone of Spanish origin or culture, which includes Sephardic Jews. The judge concluded that once Lynn showed that he had Spanish ancestry, the hearing officer should not have required him to also provide evidence that he had faced discrimination because of that ancestry.

Another example of the arbitrariness of race categories comes from Kao Lee Yang, a doctoral student in neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is Hmong, a group of people indigenous to Southeast Asia. The Hmong people are an Asian ethnic group that is, on average, low-income and very underrepresented in American higher education. Because of this, her university nominated her to apply for a fellowship aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in science. But her nomination was rejected on the grounds that she was not, in fact, underrepresented. For them she was not categorized as Hmong specifically but in the more generic ""Asian"" category-a group that is overrepresented in American higher education.

The Asian category comprises an extremely broad range of people-so broad that the Pew Research Center found wider income inequality within that category than within any other racial group: the top-earning Asians earn 10.7 times as much as the lowest-earning Asians. By comparison, the top-earning blacks earn 9.8 times as much as the lowest-earning blacks, and the top-earning whites and Hispanics earn 7.8 times as much as the lowest-earning whites and Hispanics. Disparities in income levels among Asians are matched by disparities in education levels. In 2015, 72 percent of Indians over 25 had at least a bachelor&#39s degree. Yet only 9 percent of Bhutanese did.

All of the foregoing examples illustrate that the race categories we&#39ve created are arbitrary-not only with respect to science but also with respect to the social policy objectives they are used for. Yet despite that arbitrariness, these categories have a huge impact on people&#39s lives. Whether you&#39re eligible for a scholarship, admission to a prestigious school, government funding to help your small business, or a variety of other societal benefits depends on whether you land on one side or the other of a nonsensical racial line. These racial distinctions are bound to unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain people. They constitute a textbook case of injustice.

The arbitrariness of race is not a fixable problem. It&#39s built into the very act of classifying people by race. In apartheid South Africa, government officials would run a pencil through people&#39s hair to determine their race. If the pencil went through, you were legally white. If it didn&#39t, you were legally colored. However more enlightened we believe ourselves to be (and we are in many ways), our methods of classifying people by race are equally absurd. We just can&#39t see it because we take our conventions for granted. We cringe when we hear old recordings of people describe Asians as ""yellow"" and Native Americans as ""red,"" then we proceed to talk about ""black,"" ""brown,"" and ""white"" people with a straight face-as if the generations past were simpletons with respect to racial classification, but we are far superior.

Introduction

El Salvador always felt like a movie to me.

It required imagining, editing, and borrowing scenes from films and stories to connect with the country of my birth. The first months of my life took place in the buzzing capital city of San Salvador, but when I was three months old, my family and I became refugees fleeing a war. My roots grew into a distant tale as we found ourselves in Los Angeles, California. When it came to visualizing my homeland, I had to piece together the tape in my mind from whatever exposure to Salvadoran culture I could find.

When my dad shared stories about fighting in the war, I didn’t yet have many pictures of El Salvador, so Hollywood was my reference. Scenes from Platoon flooded my mind; watching that movie was my dad’s way of understanding the memories he had battled in his youth. Instead of young white American soldiers, my mind projected a youthful version of my dad: a skinny, wide-eyed teenager with dark hair that stuck up from his forehead. I imagined a look of fear on his face. Actors playing soldiers on a set in Vietnam helped me fill in the gaps of what life must have been like for my young father fighting in the jungle. But I learned that movies, however helpful, were not enough. They could never capture the essence of El Salvador—they just gave me fragments. They could not portray the good times, the sarcastic humor, or the endearing aspects of our culture.

When my mother shared her stories, cumbia music filled in the score, its exciting rhythm filled the soundtrack. I saw a light-haired little girl running fast through a Salvadoran marketplace in her school uniform. My mother’s stories conjured images of mischievous play, adventures, tree climbing, fruit feasts, and friendship—a reimagined Little Rascals meets The Sandlot, with a touch of Pretty in Pink. There was a lightness in her tales, a curiosity, and a sense of playfulness that clashed with what my father told. Their experiences were polar opposites, yet they were both true.

My parents told these tales at the table, over frijoles licuados, crema, queso duro blando, and Salvi tortillas. There was hardly a time when eating family dinner didn’t involve recounting memories about El Salvador; I came to expect a side of story to be passed along with the tortillas. I realize now how crucial those moments were in my formation. As the food nourished my physical form, these stories nourished my soul—the truly hungry part of me, the part that wanted to understand the land I had left as an infant. The movie I constructed in my mind gradually faded, and food, family, and Salvi friends helped me put flesh and soil into El Salvador from afar.

Each evening’s menu told me what kind of stories we would hear at the dinner table. Pollo Guisado con Aceitunas (page 158) meant I might hear about my grandmother and how she learned to cook while working as a housekeeper for upper-middle-class Salvadorans in the 1960s. I listened intently as I curated each perfect spoonful of chicken, rice, and olives and chased them with bites of Salvadoran green salad—a platter of sliced radishes, cucumber spears, watercress stems, and fresh lettuce.

If, by some miracle, someone managed to forage the national flower of El Salvador, flor de izote, in Los Angeles, my mom would cook it for breakfast. She would sauté onions and tomatoes before adding the petals and scrambling in eggs. Over all the sizzling, she would say, “Cómole gusta la flor de izote a tu papá.” She served it with frijoles Salvadoreños, fresh tortillas, and aguacate. “Mmmm, que rico, ¡flor de izote! ¿Quién encontró la flor Tere?” my dad would ask.

It was during one of those food-and-story sessions that my dad said, “When you go to college, you can’t forget where you came from. I’m going to make sure of that.”

Afraid that I would forget mis raíces, my papito told me when I was seventeen that we would take our first trip back to the homeland. He didn’t know about the movie I had constructed in my mind as a child, nor did he fully comprehend the stories I had archived to piece together my identity. My Salvadoran roots were already as impossible for me to forget as my own name, but I knew this trip would encourage them to grow deeper.

This trip was a pilgrimage, a visit to the holy places and sites where my family had lost their innocence and joy and taken up the burden as survivors. I’d already been doing the work of remembering when my father urgently decided it was time to go back: Trust in the Lord. Remember what He has done for you, Karlita. Remember what He has done for our family. Don’t forget what happened. Don’t forget who you are. Don’t forget our pain. Don’t forget the joy we fought for.

I felt most Salvi when I was surrounded by family and food. I felt rich, eating dishes from our roots and listening to my parents talking about fincas (farms), arboles de mango (mango trees), and their many adventures in bachillerato (high school). Salvadoran food and flavors brought my life a sense of grounding and belonging.

When I was in elementary school, asking my mom about our traditional recipes became a habit. She often found my curiosity frustrating because I was looking for an easy answer to something that had taken her whole life to develop. As I got older, I tried different methods. I asked her to dictate her techniques so that I could write them down. She’d roll her eyes and say, “Ay, Karla.”

She defaulted to the tried-and-true custom of passing down recipes, techniques, and tips orally; at other times, she suggested hands-on practice.

“¿Mami, cómo sabes que le falta?” I asked.

“Ay, Karlita, solo sabes. Tu paladar te dice que es lo que falta,” she said. How did she know what was missing when she tasted a dish she was cooking? Her palate was her answer.

My pressing curiosity about Salvadoran cooking led me to the internet, where I was shocked to discover that—in this country where more than two million Salvadorans reside—Amazon listed only two Salvadoran cookbooks. One was in Spanish and published in El Salvador, while the second was in English and self-published. This severe lack of representation fueled me to take matters into my own hands. I decided to interview the Salvi women in my life and record their recipes because their stories were too precious not to document and share. And this documentation became the start of my life’s work.
