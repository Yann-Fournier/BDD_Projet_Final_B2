Phoebe Waller-Bridge,"Oh, Fleabag. The hot priest. The pencil haircut. The closing scene. I don&#39t think there has ever been a show that dominated the pop culture conversation and captured the nation&#39s hearts quite like Fleabag. When it was confirmed that the second season would be the final one, a collective mourning was palpable on Twitter and in offices alike. Fortunately, creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge keeps giving us a little more...And now we have a book to clutch: Fleabag: The Scriptures is filled with the filming scripts, stage directions and new writing from PWB herself. It&#39s a sacred text, if ever there was one. ― Red Magazine

Featuring an insight into the show&#39s delightfully funny stage directions and a number of previously unheard set secrets, this collection of scripts and behind-the-scenes notes from Phoebe Waller-Bridge is a must read for fans ― The I

There&#39s a good reason television screenplays aren&#39t often sold as mainstream books - ""Man enters room, looks around"" isn&#39t necessarily soul-capturing stuff. But it&#39s worth making an exception for Phoebe Waller-Bridge&#39s Fleabag: The Scriptures, naughtily bound to look like an old Bible. The show confirmed her skills as a comic actress, but seeing the words in black and white crystallises her brilliance as a writer who can so expertly build the comedy of a scene to bursting point. It&#39s often very moving, too ― Evening Standard

It was with scepticism that I picked up this volume . . . Then I read it. Bliss. The scripts are written with such precise technical skill that it is a pleasure and an education to see their workings . . . It&#39s a fun exercise to overlap in your mind the sound, the rhythm of the edit and the performances as you read these scripts, highly controlled though they are . . . Occasionally mumblings can be deciphered, script in hand, and ad-libs that aren&#39t in the script identified. A good study of the moments of genius . . . Perhaps Fleabag is best left to speak for itself. Scripts as Scriptures. Amen ― Spectator",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Emily Timberlake,"Introduction

“Miss Patridge requires large amounts of sugar for her morning tea, and Lord Abernathy, he will refuse to eat any meat that is not well cooked, while Lady Abernathy will only consume her meat bloody, I am told.” —Lady Violet Bridgerton, to her housekeeper


For members of the ton, life is an uninterrupted parade of morning visits, al fresco luncheons, dinners, balls, and other social obligations. To most of us, it sounds like a charmed existence: flitting from party to party, with an occasional stop at the modiste to pick up a new dress or Gunter’s for tea and ice cream. But ask any ambitious mama, and she will tell you that entertaining (and being entertained) is no trifling matter. Lives, fortunes, and the sanctity of ancient family lineages depend on it.

At its heart, the London social season is an opportunity for the most powerful families of Great Britain to forge alliances. “Most marriages of the ton are, in fact, mere matters of business, my dear,” Lady Danbury tells Kate Sharma. But unlike barristers and bankers, members of the English aristocracy do not have offices. Instead, their work takes place on promenades through Hyde Park, over tea in Mayfair drawing rooms, or on hunts at country estates.

All of this means that the stakes for any given party are extremely high. Being a poor hostess is simply not an option. If your lemonade is too sweet (or not sweet enough), your meat pies are too dry, or your dessert table isn’t sufficiently overabundant, then people will talk. Worse still, they will leave early and refuse future invitations.

It is no coincidence that the families with the best cooks also have the happiest and most robust social lives. When your intended guest is choosing between two equally compelling breakfast invitations, being able to offer a consistently delicious cup of tea will give you the competitive edge. If you can also promise cream-filled profiteroles (page 121) and crumbly bacon scones (page 137), then their acceptance of your invitation is all but guaranteed.

The book you are holding distills the secrets of the best hosts and hostesses of the ton. Their cooks have graciously shared more than forty recipes for finger foods and libations—everything you could possibly need to host your own Bridgerton-inspired soirée. Nobody knows her way around a Blackberry and Citrus Curd Bar (page 143) better than Lady Danbury, and Violet Bridgerton’s Miniature Pommes Anna (page 27) are the stuff of legend. Learn how to make a fragrant Masala Chai (page 85) à la Kate Sharma, and you might find a viscount who loves you, too.

In addition to the recipes for beverages and hors d’oeuvres, you will find special features that demystify some of the more arcane rules of English high society. If these rules seem confusing, it is very much by design. It is easy to identify outsiders if they don’t know how to curtsy or understand the difference between a countess and a viscountess. But with this book as your guide, you will be able to navigate even the most exclusive social situation with grace.

If this book inspires you to gather your nearest and dearest around you, then it has done its job. It doesn’t matter whether you’re celebrating a birthday, engagement, the launch of a new social season, or merely the end of a long workweek. Regardless of the occasion, the recipes that follow guarantee a good time will be had by all.

May your parties be delicious, well attended, and fruitful!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/m4jp5nfp1mddi7hibuiq6nsiir._SY600_.jpg

Michael Azerrad,"""Music journalist Azerrad provides an electric revision to his 1993 account of the defining band of the grunge movement. (...) The band’s myriad fans will be rapt."" — Publishers Weekly (starred review)
Thirty years after its original publication, rock writer Azerrad (Our Band Could Be Your Life) updates and nearly doubles the number of pages of his groundbreaking Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana. The author intersperses hundreds of new, detailed paragraphs throughout the original text to amplify and clarify the earlier material. Most satisfying, he adds a lengthy epilogue which deals with events that happened after the 1991 release of the album Nevermind, including Kurt Cobain’s last months and tragic death in 1994. New material includes the Nirvana tours and practice sessions that Azerrad attended; Cobain’s meeting with one of his heroes, William Burroughs; the telltale signs that pointed to Cobain’s self-destructive impulses and his eventual death; and the utter remorse that Azerrad and other insiders felt after Cobain’s suicide at age 27. VERDICT (...) Nirvana fans will want to read it. — Library Journal (starred review)
""Michael Azerrad has always demonstrated a passionate feeling for the ideas, the ambitions, that drive the notable moments of recent musical history. But this annotated edition of his earlier book, which was already a very successful biography, breaks out even further into high art. He&#39s the perfect narrator, now, for a very important question, perhaps increasingly forgotten: why was punk important and how do we talk about it now? The urgencies of this question are everywhere in this powerful, uncertain, and profoundly human work. Azzerad&#39s restless plunging onward, represents the further entanglement in deep, fraught, endangered wisdom."" — Rick Moody, bestselling author of The Ice Storm and Hotels of North America
“Enriched with new anecdotes, insights and info-morsels, this super-expanded Michael Azerrad classic is a great story made even more gripping. Nirvana’s underground-overground arc becomes a prism for understanding an entire era of rock music and pop culture.” — Simon Reynolds, author of Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-84

Allan Kozinn,"“Volume 1 of The McCartney Legacy by Allan Kozinn and Adrian Sinclair, arrives like a well-planned encore a year after the publication of The Lyrics: 1956 to the Present by Paul McCartney. Influenced by the methods of Mark Lewisohn, the exacting Beatles historian currently at work on the second volume of a trilogy about the group (the first was 900 pages, and that was an abridgment)... in a way The McCartney Legacy out-Lewisohns Lewisohn, taking almost 700 pages to cover only five years.”  — New York Times Book Review
“This is the comprehensive, painstaking, dazzling and definitive chronicle of rock’s strangest story: how Paul McCartney refused to go quietly after the Beatles, and how he kept his genius moving forward into another day. An amazing, inspiring trip.”  — Rob Sheffield, author of Dreaming the Beatles
“No maybe—I’m plain amazed at this real reveal of Paul McCartney with his decades of artful creativity. Through these pages is the accurate biography of a universal explorer.”  — Mark Lewisohn, world-renowned Beatles expert
“Allan Kozinn and Adrian Sinclair’s The McCartney Legacy: Volume 1, 1969-73 is a triumph... their masterful study of the artist’s spectacular rise from the ashes of the Beatles, Kozinn and Sinclair bring McCartney&#39s comeback story vividly to life.”  — Salon.com
“Anybody in the future who wants to know anything about the subject will find the information here. Allan Kozinn and Adrian Sinclair, a former New York Times music critic and a documentary maker respectively, have entirely succeeded in the task they set themselves—to find out and inform the reader of everything there is to know about the life of Paul McCartney between 1969 and 1973.”  — The Times (UK)",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/q9omclf3cm9qvddmjqu5ta9b2e._SY600_.jpg
