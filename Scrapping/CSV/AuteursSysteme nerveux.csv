As someone who is neurodivergent, I think Ellie Middleton is the perfect voice to represent what is a beautiful but vastly misunderstood way of being. Her work is so important, this book will be a gamechanger. ― Joshua Fletcher, aka @AnxietyJosh

A compassionate and informative account of how to work with your brain and the patchwork nature of diversity. Neurologists listen - you need to use this in your diagnoses ― Camilla Pang, author of the prize-winning Explaining Humans

Paul Kalanithi,"Revue de presse
A vital book about dying. Awe-inspiring and exquisite. Obligatory reading for the living. -- Nigella Lawson

Rattling. Heartbreaking. Beautiful. -- Atul Gawande, author of BEING MORTAL

A great, indelible book ... as intimate and illuminating as Atul Gawande’s “Being Mortal,” to cite only one recent example of a doctor’s book that has had exceptionally wide appeal ... I guarantee that finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option ... gripping from the start ... None of it is maudlin. Nothing is exaggerated. As he wrote to a friend: “It’s just tragic enough and just imaginable enough.” And just important enough to be unmissable. ― New York Times

Powerful and poignant. ― The Sunday Times

Less a memoir than a reflection on life and purpose… A vital book. ― The Economist

Extraordinary...Remarkable... luminous, revelatory memoir about mortality and what makes being alive meaningful ... Lyrical, intimate, insistent and profound. Kalanithi had the mind of the polymath and the ear of a poet. ― Daily Telegraph

Powerful and poignant… Elegantly written posthumous memoir… Should be compulsory for anyone who intends to be a doctor… A profound reflection on the meaning of life. ― Sunday Times

A stark, fascinating, well-written and heroic memoir. -- Stefanie Marsh ― The Times

Exceptional. -- Katie Law ― Evening Standard

When I came to the end of the last flawless paragraph of When Breath Becomes Air, all I could do was turn to the first page and read the whole thing again. Searingly intelligent, beautifully written, and beyond brave, I haven't been so marked by a book in years. -- Gabriel Weston, author of DIRECT RED

A remarkable book… Kalanithi writes very well, in a plain and matter-of-fact way, without a trace of self-pity, and you are immediately gripped and carried along… [He] was clearly a deeply thoughtful and compassionate man, and his death is a great loss to medicine, but at least he has left this remarkable book behind. ― Observer

A meditation on what makes a life worth living. ― Guardian

It turns out not really to be about dying at all but about life and how to live it ― though the closeness of death gives it an urgency and economy… When Breath Becomes Air is a Renaissance book from a Renaissance man. It is a work of philosophy and morality, a reconciliation of science and religion. There is even plot and excitement… It was only with the restrained, elegant epilogue written by his wife Lucy Kalanithi that I found myself weeping helplessly…When Breath Becomes Air tells us what means to live a good life, by giving us a glimpse into an exceptional one. ― Financial Times

A powerful and compelling read. ― The Economist, Book of the Year

An astonishingly affecting memoir and eloquent examination of what it is to be human and confront your own mortality… This is a remarkable book by a man who was driven by his passion for his life, his loves and his career. His death is undoubtedly a tragedy but in writing this memoir he has guaranteed that his voice and the important story it tells will resonate for years to come. ― Daily Express

As thought-provoking as it was moving. The sheer exuberance of Kalnithi’s intellectual curiosity shone through in his writing. ― Evening Standard, Book of the Year

Dr Kalanithi describes, clearly and simply, and entirely without self-pity, his journey from innocent medical student to professionally detached and all-powerful neurosurgeon to helpless patient, dying from cancer. He learns lessons about the reality of illness and the doctor-patient relationship that most doctors only learn in old age but Paul Kalanithi died at the tragically early age of 37.

Every doctor should read this book - written by a member of our own tribe, it helps us understand and overcome the barriers we all erect between ourselves and our patients as soon as we are out of medical school


To the venerable canon of doctors who could write (from Chekhov to Oliver Sacks and Atul Gawande), another name can be added: that of Paul Kalanithi… Brilliantly written. ― Sunday Telegraph

Paul Kalanithi’s memoir, When Breath Becomes Air… split my head open with its beauty. Truly. Madly. Deeply.

Thanks to When Breath Becomes Air, those of us who never met Paul Kalanithi will both mourn his death and benefit from his life. This one of a handful of books I consider to be a universal donor - I would recommend it to anyone, everyone. -- Ann Patchett, author of BEL CANTO
Quatrième de couverture
At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, the next he was a patient struggling to live. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a medical student asking what makes a virtuous and meaningful life into a neurosurgeon working in the core of human identity – the brain – and finally into a patient and a new father. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when when life is catastrophically interrupted? What does it mean to have a child as your own life fades away? Paul Kalanithi died while working on this profoundly moving book, yet his words live on as a guide to us all. When Breath Becomes Air is a life-affirming reflection on facing our mortality and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a gifted writer who became both.

Anne-Marie Bonnet,"Jusqu'à il y a une dizaine d'années, la maladie de Parkinson, décrite pour la première fois en 1817, était essentiellement considérée par les médecins, les chercheurs, les personnes touchées par cette maladie et leurs proches sur le versant des troubles moteurs. Ces troubles s'expriment par une lenteur, une raideur et, dans un tiers des cas, par un tremblement de repos. Pourtant, d'autres symptômes peuvent aussi être présents et compliquer la vie au quotidien. C'est le cas des troubles cognitifs qui sont, dans la plupart des cas, subtils et qui se manifestent principalement sous la forme de ce qu'on appelle les troubles dysexécutifs, c'est le cas aussi des difficultés psychologiques comme l'anxiété, la dépression et les hallucinations qui peuvent se rencontrer sur le parcours de la maladie ou encore des troubles du comportement tels que les ""addictions"" qui peuvent avoir de graves conséquences.
Après le succès de La maladie de Parkinson au jour le jour, consacré à la maladie dans sa globalité, les auteurs ont choisi de se focaliser sur ces troubles encore largement méconnus des médecins non spécialistes, souvent tardivement diagnostiqués et pouvant avoir de sérieuses répercussions sur la gestion de la maladie et la vie avec l'entourage.
Dans l'esprit de la collection des ""guides pratiques de l'aidant"", ce livre a pour objectif de donner des clés au malade mais aussi à ses proches pour :
repérer, comprendre et faire face aux troubles cognitifs ;
gérer les difficultés psychologiques et mieux vivre au jour le jour la maladie ;
limiter les conséquences des troubles comportementaux ;
encourager et faciliter la communication sur ces troubles à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de la famille ;

Kris Newby,"Revue de presse
Full of fascinating and sometimes-disturbing information, little of which is widely known. — Kirkus Reviews (starred review)
Quatrième de couverture
While vacationing on Martha’s Vineyard, Kris Newby was bitten by an unseen tick. That one bite changed her life forever, pulling her into the abyss of a devastating illness that took ten doctors to diagnose and years to recover from: Newby had joined the ranks of the 400,000 Americans who are afflicted with Lyme disease each year.
As a science writer, she was driven to understand why this disease is so misunderstood and its patients so mistreated. This quest led her to Willy Burgdorfer, the Lyme microbe’s discoverer, who revealed that he had developed bug-borne bioweapons during the Cold War and believed that the Lyme epidemic was started by a military experiment gone wrong.
In a superb, meticulous work of narrative journalism, Bitten takes readers on a journey to investigate these claims—from tours of biological weapons facilities to interviews with biosecurity experts and microbiologists doing cutting-edge research—all the while uncovering darker truths about Burgdorfer. It also leads Newby to uncomfortable questions about why Lyme can be so difficult to both diagnose and treat, and why the government is so reluctant to classify chronic Lyme as a disease.
A gripping, infectious page-turner, Bitten will shed a terrifying new light on an epidemic that is exacting an incalculable toll on us, upending much of what we believe we know about it.

–Psychology Today

""This is an accessible guide for a lay audience on science that could radically alter the understanding of anxiety and depression, along with a host of other conditions."" –Publishers Weekly

“…I recommend reading The Psychobiotic Revolution by Scott C. Anderson.” –Forbes.com

“Although decidedly aimed at the lay reader, the tone throughout is very humorous; I found myself swiftly turning pages, excitedly anticipating the next witty joke. Overall, this is a great book that encourages you to 'take charge of your gut to optimize your mind and your mood'. This is a book that you would reluctantly lend to friends, in the fear that they might not return it.” –Lancet 

""The hope is that it may one day be possible to diagnose some brain diseases and mental health problems by analysing gut bacteria, and to treat them – or at least augment the effects of drug treatments – with specific bacteria. Cryan and his colleague Ted Dinan call these mood-altering germs “psychobiotics”, and have co-written a book with the American science writer Scott C Anderson called The Psychobiotic Revolution."" —The Guardian

""The Psychobiotic Revolution could change how you think."" —sultanabun.com

""The authors of The Psychobiotic Revolution present clear research that we are indeed what we eat and that our lives would be much more enjoyable if we could balance our gut health in order to balance the rest of us."" —Peppermint PhD. blog

“This book is written for a lay person.  It does a very good job of explaining some difficult concepts in a way that will be easily understood by people who don’t have any biology background without dumbing the subject matter down so much that people with more knowledge would cringe as they read it.  That’s a fine line to walk.” –Spirit blog

“Many of my burning questions were answered in a simple and succinct way that makes the battle to improve our health and diet much more feasible.” –Jathan & Heather blog

“Packed with the latest scientific research, [the book] informs and fascinates” –Literary Quicksand blog

“The authors have combined all the most significant information and then gleaned out the important issues that the reader needs to know in an extremely easy to read book, which becomes a real page-turner.  This short book certainly relates to “You are what you Eat!” –Patricia’s Wisdom blog

“This authoritative yet engaging book provides up-to-the minute research and practical advice on the gut-brain axis, perhaps the most exciting area of science today. Written by some of the leaders in the field, it gives terrific insight into what is going on in the gut, how to change it to improve mood, and the largely unappreciated links between mental health and the many other diseases now linked to the gut microbiome.”
—Rob Knight, Director of the Center for Microbiome Innovation, University of California at San Diego, author of Follow Your Gut and coauthor of Dirt is Good

“Anderson, Cryan and Dinan have infused life into cutting edge research that is often still mired in the scientific language…. The authors take on a near impossible task, to translate 150 years of research into the infinite complexity of human behavior and make it digestible. Compelling, engaging and informative, this book teaches us why microbes may affect all of our decisions…. This is brain food!”",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/sivvk2a16uulkk1np99243hk4h._SY600_.jpg
