Shalane Flanagan,"Extrait
As runners we are so focused on our immediate energy needs that we obsess over macronutrients and forget that not all proteins, fats, and carbs are created equal. The stress that running puts on the body means that to stay healthy, runners need more antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals than most. In a culture accustomed to processed foods, produce shipped from halfway around the world, and factory-farmed meats, it&#39s more difficult than ever to fulfill our nutritional needs. As a result, runners everywhere are missing out on the nourishment their bodies need to thrive.

The chance to teach endurance athletes like you how to nourish your body for the long run is what inspired us to pour our hearts into this book. We aren&#39t suggesting you eat this way solely to crush your PR or to cross the finish line first. This book can help you do just that, but we&#39re also looking past the finish line and aiming for lifelong health and happiness.

Before you dive into our recipes, we want to impart some of our healthy- eating wisdom. For us, deciding what to eat, in order to eat well, has become second nature--a way of life. But to many of our fellow runners, our way of eating might at first sound foreign and daunting. Fear not. You&#39re about to discover that our approach to maximizing nourishment so that your body can perform at its best puts flavor and fun at the forefront.

We all know what ""run fast"" means, right? Get out there and kick some @#*! We want you to be able to do just that and more. In a broader sense, ""run fast"" means not just surviving but thriving in our insanely fast-paced lifestyles--lifestyles that don&#39t seem conducive to having the time (or energy) to cook. We&#39ll convince you otherwise!

But what do we really mean by ""eat slow""? It means so much more than simply taking the time to chew your food. It represents our way of eating that includes preparing nourishing meals from scratch, sitting down at a table instead of eating on the go, enjoying food in the company of friends and family, seeking out foods that were grown or raised with care, and tuning in to what our bodies need to thrive.

RUNNING ON EMPTY

Despite all the medical discoveries over the last 50 years, humankind is far from thriving. In fact, we are less healthy today than our grandparents. For the first time in history, children born today potentially have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. Occurrences of chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and depression are at an all-time high. Studies show that unhealthy diets are a leading cause of these preventable diseases.

Although runners are put on a pedestal as the epitome of health, we know all too well that runners and other endurance athletes are far from immune to these serious health issues. The convenience foods coveted by runners, including bars, gels, and sports drinks, not only lack real nutrition, but also are high in inflammatory foods like refined grains, processed sweeteners, industrial oils, and artificial ingredients.

There are more than 600,000 food items in the marketplace today: 80 percent of them have added sugar, and the majority of packaged foods are nutrient poor and contain chemical additives. Scary, considering that for most Americans, packaged foods make up 70 percent of their diet.

As a result of our reliance on nutrient-poor processed foods, the majority of Americans are overfed, undernourished, and running on empty. Refined foods provide mass without sustenance. For an athlete, running on empty can lead to immediate negative consequences and long-term health concerns.

On top of this, runners are constantly bombarded with messages about weight loss, calorie counts, juice cleanses, low-carb diets, low-fat diets--the list goes on. These messages lead to an unhealthy relationship with food, imbalanced eating, food phobias, obsessions over weight loss, yo-yo dieting, cravings, undernourishment, weight fluctuations, and eating disorders.

It is estimated that at least half of the running population is sidelined at some point during the year due to an injury. The right nourishment can help an athlete recover from injury. Food can be incredibly healing, but the Standard American Diet (SAD) is high in inflammatory foods and low in healing foods. For an athlete who is constantly breaking down the body during intense training sessions, nutrient-dense foods are critical to a faster recovery time.

According to Ron Thompson, PhD, FAED, CEDS, coauthor of Eating Disorders in Sport, ""When coaches and athletes are asked what is the major contributor to good athletic performance, they often say things like VO2 max, training load, or a particular type of training. Such factors are important in sport performance, but with such responses, athletes and coaches are missing the basics. Other than genetics, the major contributor to good athletic performance is good health, and the major contributor to good health (other than genetics) is good nutrition. The well-nourished athlete will not only perform better, but will perform better longer.""

With so much misleading information out there--most of it driven by food corporations--it&#39s no surprise that something as basic and intuitive as eating has become so complex. The result of being bombarded with food products everywhere we turn is that we&#39re no longer in tune with one of our most basic needs: eating. We have lost the instinct to reach for the foods that will best fuel our demanding lifestyles.

INDULGENT NOURISHMENT

""Indulgent nourishment"" is how we define our way of eating. We know our hardworking bodies need substantial fuel, so we indulge in our favorite whole foods. By filling up on the healthful foods we love and not obsessing over calorie counts, carbs, or fat, we&#39re able to eat in tune with what our bodies need. We know that real food leads to serious satisfaction and allows the body to function optimally without weight gain.

On the other hand, we believe that dieting leads to imbalanced eating, which results in sugar cravings, snack attacks, and, in the end, weight gain. Instead of focusing on calorie counts, we focus our energy on eating a balanced diet rich in wholesome foods--foods that keep us energized and satisfied.

The recipes in this cookbook do not include calorie counts or macronutrient (carbs, protein, fat) measurements. This wasn&#39t an oversight but intentional. Don&#39t ask us how many grams of protein are in our High- Altitude Bison Meatballs with Simple Marinara (page 120) or how many grams of fat are in our Superhero Muffins (page 42). We don&#39t know and we don&#39t care. Instead we&#39ll tell you all about the incredible phytochemicals, antioxidants, and omega 3s and the exciting ways these delicious foods can help supercharge your training.

All macronutrients are not created equal. Judging the health of a food based on how many grams of protein or fat it has is dangerous because these numbers don&#39t reveal the nutrient quality of the food. It&#39s akin to buying a pair of running shoes based solely on their weight without looking at the quality of the technology or considering how the shoe feels on your foot.

EATING REAL FOOD

When deciding what to eat to eat well, it&#39s best to look at the full picture, including where the food came from, how it was grown, how much it was processed, how it tastes, and, most important, how it makes you feel.

For us that means eating a varied diet that includes meat, veggies, fruit, cultured dairy, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and more. We avoid processed foods and limit our consumption of refined grains and sugar-- these foods don&#39t make us feel good. We seek out organic and local ingredients as much as possible and enjoy eating with the seasons, since food picked at its peak not only tastes better, but also is more nutrient dense.

We don&#39t eat meat every single day, but we do believe it is healthy to include on a regular basis in our diets. In many of our dishes, the veggies shine and meat becomes the loyal side companion. As much as possible, we try to get our meat from trusted local farmers who care about the planet. The free-range chicken, beef, bison, and lamb we buy is expensive, but our philosophy is to eat better quality meat and less of it for maximum nourishment.

Not everyone can afford to buy organic all the time, but when possible try to stick to organic, local, or sustainable options when it comes to meat, seafood, dairy, and the produce on the Environmental Working Group&#39s ""Dirty Dozen"" list (annual list of the most pesticide-ridden produce). Consider ways to make budget cuts elsewhere to make good food a priority. In the United States, we spend less on food than any other developed country, a mere 6.4 percent of our total spending, and we spend more than any other country on health care. Spending at the grocery store or farmers&#39 market is an investment in your future.

We hope you&#39ll find this to be a refreshing way to eat. If you&#39re eating mostly whole foods, you don&#39t need numbers to eat healthy and balanced. But it might be difficult to let go of the numbers at first and get in tune with your body&#39s hunger signals. In our society, we&#39re programmed to think of food in terms of calories or cost (negatives) instead of in terms of nourishment and satisfaction (positives). Slowing down, taking the time to cook, and enjoying every bite will help.

FAT FOR FLAVOR AND FUEL

In our recipes, we make no apologies for the amount of fat. We sauté with olive oil, bake with butter and coconut oil, stir in whole milk yogurt, simmer with coconut milk, and drizzle on dressings and sauces.

Why?

Fat is a carrier for flavor and nutrients. Many vitamins and minerals cannot be absorbed without it. Fat is also a primary source of energy-- viable energy that can fuel your body for endurance endeavors. A meal rich in healthy fats will leave you feeling satisfied, better nourished, and less likely to reach for a sugar fix.

Runners often obsess over carbohydrates and protein and forget that fat is also an important building block. Both saturated and unsaturated fat from whole foods is critical for healthy brain function, cardiovascular strength, hormone balance, building lean muscle, and combating inflammation. Studies show a diet rich in good fats actually boosts metabolism instead of causing weight gain.

Female athletes in particular can suffer hormone imbalances without enough fat in their diets. It&#39s estimated that 20 percent of active women and up to 45 percent of female competitive runners suffer from athletic amenorrhea, which can lead to bone loss and fertility issues. When the body isn&#39t getting enough fuel, it begins to shut down systems that aren&#39t necessary for survival, and the female reproductive system is one of the first to go. Getting more high-quality calories in the diet can reverse this detrimental condition.

The fats we love for their health-giving properties and ability to transform the mundane into magic include nuts, seeds, avocados, coconut oil, olive oil, whole milk yogurt, meat, and butter (learn more about these fats in Chapter 2).

On the other hand, the oils found in packaged and fast foods are often unhealthy hydrogenated fats made in a lab via a harsh chemical process to give them a long shelf life. These inflammatory fats don&#39t have any health- redeeming properties and are stored by the body instead of burned as fuel, leading to weight gain and an increased risk of heart disease. Not cool.

We&#39ve been programmed to think of fat as bad, but remember that not all are created equal. The fats we use in the recipes that follow are body-loving, nutrient-dense, energizing fats.

Health food unfortunately has gotten a bad rap over the years for being bland and boring. It doesn&#39t have to be. There&#39s a wealth of nutrients in a range of your favorite foods (and no, they&#39re not just vegetables!) that you&#39ll be thrilled to discover in Chapter 2 as we take you on a tour of our pantries.

EAT LIKE SHALANE

Without measuring calories, you might wonder how Shalane achieves her optimal race weight. Shalane does make a conscious effort every single day to eat fresh, whole foods, but she doesn&#39t follow a diet plan. She would rather save her mad math skills for counting miles and calculating splits. She avoids processed foods and sugary snacks because these foods provide little sustenance and displace the real foods her body craves.

Leading up to a big race, Shalane will limit her consumption of sweets and give up her occasional glass of wine. Otherwise she eats like she always eats--with an appetite for nourishment and an appreciation for good food.

Since Shalane started devouring the recipes in this book, her ideal racing weight now comes naturally, without deprivation. She no longer craves sugary snacks, and she feels satisfied after every meal. This has been a refreshing game changer, allowing her to have fun in the kitchen. She now views cooking as a training tool that&#39s as important as her next workout.

To help you make the transition to a balanced whole foods-based diet, we&#39ve provided an outline of what a typical week of eating looks like for Shalane. We&#39ve included cross-references to the recipes in this book that she can&#39t live without. We&#39ve also listed her go-to recipes for fueling for race day, including what she eats the night before and the morning of her big marathons.

It&#39s important to remember that different foods affect everyone differently. You should always listen to your own body and eat what makes you feel good. Never try anything new the night before or on race day. Practice eating new foods before your training runs and learn what you digest best.

Excerpted from Chapter 1

Beginnings

Allure of the Open Water

Oceans, lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams are some of the most beautiful places on earth to swim. Nothing compares with breaking free from the confines of a swimming pool and swimming in salty or sweet waters, as far as your arms will carry you. You are immediately lifted by the water, bounced by the waves, and massaged by the movement of your body through the water.

You feel sunshine warming your back, see shafts of sunlight illuminate the water below, hear the song of the wind and the waves, and as you swim, you hear the rhythms of your hands and feet as they catch and move water. You hear the music of your body and your breath as the wind, current, swell, and tide change, and the sounds of your body changing with it. You are immersed in this water song, and each day it is different.

Each day is a great adventure. You never know what you will experience until you get in and swim.

For forty years I have swum in the open water. At age fourteen I swam across the Catalina Channel and, at age fifteen, broke the men’s and women’s world records for the English Channel. Since then, I’ve completed sixty challenging open water swims—some were world-record swims, others were firsts, and all offered unique, exciting, and interesting challenges.

The sport of open water swimming is exploding like jogging did in the 1970s in the United States and Britain. There are more than nine hundred competitive open water swims across the United States throughout the year. There is a booming business in swim travel, in which swimmers travel to beautiful and exotic places like Greece, Turkey, and the Caribbean and participate in open water camps and swim along shore, between islands, and across straits.

The reason for this phenomenal growth in the sport may be because triathlon and open water swimming have gained Olympic status, since 2000 and 2008, respectively. According to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA), an estimated 2.3 million people completed a triathlon in 2010, an increase of 55 percent from the year before, and the New York Triathlon sold out in eleven minutes despite an entry fee just shy of nine hundred dollars (see Sources for more information; page 299).

Thomas Johnson, former president and current open water swim director of the Triathlon Club of San Diego (see Sources for website address; page 299), has watched this amazing growth and was involved with organizing the 2012 ITU World Triathlon San Diego, which served as the second qualifier for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Triathlon team. He predicted that the sport would expand even more after the Olympic qualifying event and Olympic Games.

John Martin, the communications and media relations manager at USA Triathlon, said there were 122,388 USA Triathlon members in 2000 and by 2012 there were 636,335 members. Martin said:

There are many reasons such as: society’s interest in fitness and living a healthy lifestyle, the growth of the number of total races across the country, making events easier to get to, the growth in the number of the more accessible shorter sprint distance races, which made the sport more accessible to those with fewer hours to train each week, growth in the 30–49 age groups who are looking for varied outlets for fitness, an increase in the number of USA Triathlon clubs, which fosters a community concept for men and especially women who enjoy the group training and support atmosphere, an increase in resources (websites, books, magazines) that provide assistance/education in getting started, growth in multisport shops and triathlon specific training and racing gear, marketing and communications efforts of USA Triathlon, the growth in the number of USA Triathlon certified coaches who are able to provide training plans and individual attention for athletes who need guidance and motivation, and USA Triathlon–sanctioned 4,300 multisport events in 2011.

This enormous expansion of triathlon has had a huge impact on the growth of open water because swimming is one of the races included in the triathlon. There has been a dramatic increase in media visibility and interest in both triathlon and open water swimming. Young swimmers are also participating in the sport, especially those who have been involved in junior lifeguard programs. Some university and college swimming coaches are incorporating open water swims during long-distance winter training sessions, to give the athletes a break from swimming thousands of mind-numbing meters in the pool. The swimmers are enjoying the challenge of swimming in the wild blue waters. Young and older swimmers who have spent years of their lives swimming back and forth in pools are reading books and magazines about open water swimming and triathlons and are inspired to swim in untamed water. They want to train, set open water swimming goals, and discover ways to make the extreme environment of the open water accessible for themselves.

Last year there were record numbers of people swimming the English Channel (between England and Europe) and the Catalina Channel (between Catalina Island and the mainland of California). The sport has become so popular that British television now broadcasts open water swims during prime time.

What most athletes don’t realize is that open water swimming is a high-risk sport. This lack of awareness became very apparent to me on three separate occasions. The first occurred when a swimming friend in Laguna Beach, California, invited me to join him for an early dip. The fog was rolling in rapidly, reducing visibility to three hundred yards. We decided to swim only one hundred yards out to a buoy and then back in, because the fog was growing thicker, and we knew there was a chance of getting lost, even close to shore.

We met four triathletes, two men who had trained in the area a few times and two women who had never swum off that beach. They were planning to swim out to the buoy, parallel the shore, and swim toward cliffs about a half mile and back. One of the women asked if I would join them, and I said I didn’t think it was safe.

They were wearing wet suits and dark caps, and they set off into a rolling wall of fog that quickly erased the sounds of their strokes and consumed them. Had they considered what would happen to them if the fog suddenly grew thicker; what they would do if they became separated or disoriented? Did they know how to find their way back to shore? Did they realize that they were completely invisible in the fog? Did they realize boaters and Jet Skiers wouldn’t be able to see them and could easily run over them? They were oblivious to the risk they had taken or their responsibility to ensure the safety of their group. They were lucky they made it back without a problem.

A few weeks later, a friend who was just learning how to swim in the ocean was swimming parallel to shore outside the surf line. He had completed his workout and was turning in to the beach to swim to shore.

He forgot that he needed to look back to check the surf conditions. He was completely unaware that the dark blue long bump in the ocean was a wave growing behind him. He did not realize that this wave was a shore break. He suddenly felt the wave rapidly lifting him higher and higher and higher, tipping him forward and launching him into the air. He felt himself falling and the water rushing around him and suddenly pounding him into the beach.

He closed his eyes and felt himself flipping over the falls as tons of water crashed onto his body. He spun around and tried to find air, but the white water filled with sand was holding him under. His head finally broke the surface for a moment, and he gasped for a breath and tried to get his feet under him, but another wave, just as large, crashed on him and bounced him like a basketball on the beach.

He was submerged for what seemed like forever, but at last he planted his feet, stood up, and stumbled toward shore. The rip created by the backwash dragged him backward into the path of the approaching wave.

For the first time, he glanced over his shoulder and saw the next wave cresting. He leaned forward and, using his core strength, fought the backwash, pushed hard into the sand with feet, and staggered out of the water, coughing, his goggles twisted on his head, sand streaming down his face, shoulders, chest, sides, and filling his swimsuit. He looked up at his friends who had run down the beach to help him. He waved and smiled sheepishly and said he was okay. He understood that he could have been severely hurt in the shore break.

Shortly after that, I watched another swimmer, in his midforties, swimming off Seal Beach, California. He was breathing only on the right side of his body, so he was completely blind on the left. Because of this breathing pattern, he pulled stronger with his right arm than with his left. He had no spatial awareness, no sense of ocean navigation, and he could not see that he was swimming right into an area of heavy boating traffic. He had no idea that he was putting himself in danger. He was okay once he reached shore.

It was because of these events and many others that I realized there needed to be a book for all levels of open water swimmers, including those of us who have been swimming in the open water for years but still have so much to learn.

Scientists, physicians, lifeguards, and other experts offered to provide key information to help swimmers become more aware of the open water environment and to know how to handle themselves in the water.

Expert Sources and Credentials

Even though I’d completed swims in remote parts of the world and I’d worked with various navies and coast guards to achieve my goals, I knew that there was so much more to know about seamanship, risk management, and other topics connected to open water swimming.

A friend in the United States Air Force offered to put me in touch with the U.S. Navy SEALs. The SEALs are members of the United States Naval Special Warfare unit, or NSW, who are trained for unconventional warfare; “SEAL” is an acronym for “sea, air, and land.” NSW is the agency that provides units to conduct maritime special operations, since the SEALs are America’s elite maritime force. They know more about operational risk management than anyone; they are the experts in assessing, reducing, and mitigating risks. They have established protocols that they abide by to ensure safety. They are experts in seamanship, can work in teams, and know how to survive in the wildest ocean conditions.

The SEALs welcomed me to their base in Coronado, California, to observe their sessions with the trainees, instructors, and officers, to see the best in the world train, to understand the way the elite force implements safety measures, and to observe how everything is done in a completely professional way.

I was allowed to sit in during the instructors’ discussions about the trainees, which enabled me to understand the amount of planning, discussion, and attention to detail that goes into each training evolution, or session. They discussed everything in precise detail: how to initiate drills and exercises, how long each one will last, how to ensure the trainees’ safety, how often the trainees hydrate, how frequently the metal scuba tanks sitting in the hot sun are cooled to prevent the trainees from being burned. They reviewed how they would inspect each trainee, what errors to check for, and the number of push-ups trainees would do if they made a mistake. They also let me see the high-risk documentation that ensured the trainees’ safety. Equally important, the SEALs let me see the level of qualification required by every instructor who supervises a training event, whether it’s something as simple as a run or as complex as a dive.

The senior SEAL who contributed so much invaluable information, anecdotal stories, and guidance cannot be named because he is on active duty, so I will refer to him as L. Tadeus. His credentials are tremendously impressive. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy, earned his commission as an officer, and spent fourteen years working in the U.S. Navy SEAL teams—eight years operational and six years in a high-risk training capacity, supervising almost every type of high-risk maritime training conducted by Special Operations Forces (SOF). He has spent three years specifically conducting physical training events, from 2-mile to 5.5-mile (3.2-kilometer to 8.8-kilometer) swims and 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) runs. He is a Combatant Dive Training subject matter expert; Command Diving Officer and Diving Supervisor; Submersible Pilot/Navigator; and Military Small Craft Operator. The SEAL is trained in all levels of Operational Risk Management, is a Military Master Training Specialist (MTS) 9502 NEC, and has earned numerous civilian maritime certifications, up to and including two-hundred-ton boats, and is a certified Captain Near Coastal (International Yacht Training [IYT]).

Among L. Tadeus’s many training credentials is an additional qualification that made a huge difference to this manual. Like other senior SEALs, he has analyzed and investigated accidents that occurred during training. When he was not the actual Investigating Officer, he closely followed safety mishap investigations in cooperation with his Command Safety Manager to ensure that appropriate lessons were learned, and he institutionalized those lessons within the training curriculum so that no one would have to relearn them the hard way. He offered me many helpful illustrations of dangerous swim-training scenarios. He provided recommendations for finding support boats and people, equipment, and methods for incorporating risk management into open water swimming. He also gave me pearls of wisdom that he earned and learned through challenging experiences as a SEAL, an instructor, and a leader. He shared his knowledge generously to help open water swimmers swim safely and to help them achieve their worthy goals.

Rick Knepper also provided invaluable information. Rick is a sixty-three-year-old retired Navy SEAL Master Chief who has spent the past forty-five years with the Naval Special Warfare community, both for active duty and civil service. He has approximately thirty years working within the SEAL schoolhouse, with extensive time training SEAL candidates in all fundamental aquatic skills and surface swimming for ocean swims up to five and a half nautical miles. Additionally, he has been an aquatics trainer for numerous instructors’ staffs over the years and continues to fulfill this need when required. He has revised and designed various aquatic programs with the SEAL training pipeline and has served as an aquatics consultant with other navy organizations. For the past twenty-five years, Rick has been swimming open water marathons. At the age of fifty, he completed the Catalina Channel crossing and a local twenty-four-mile sanctioned solo swim off San Diego. He is currently training for a thirty-six-mile (57.9-kilometer) swim scheduled in 2013 off Coronado Island.
Revue de presse
Praise for Lynne Cox&#39s Open Water Swimming Manual

""A paean to outdoor immersion. . . . [Cox] has channeled her vast expertise on the dangers, joys and logistics of open water swimming into a new book aimed at the exploding ranks of triathletes and other swimmers who are escaping the safe confines of pools. . . . The publication could hardly be better timed. A steep rise in the popularity of triathlons has been swelling the ranks of open water events. . . . [Cox] tempers vision and enthusiasm with methodical, unstinting effort.""
—Andrea Kannapell, The New York Times

""Lynne Cox’s books are the works of a singular mind. That was true for the best sellers Swimming to Antarctica and Grayson, and it is true for her new book, Open Water Swimming Manual, a 300-page paperback instructional that is the most unlikely page-turner you could put on your summer reading list. She’s written a sort of fantasy in which you, the reader, are the protagonist. You can’t swim half a mile? Cox will put you on a program to swim 10! . . . Cox’s Open Water Swimming Manual could do for long-distance swimming what Jim Fixx’s The Complete Book of Running did for the American jogging movement in 1977.""
—Sports Illustrated

""Lynne Cox is an artist of the open water. No one knows more about swimming&#39s beauty and skill than this great champion, or could describe it with such clarity and grace. Every sport—every art—should have a book like this and a guide like Lynne Cox.""
—Christopher McDougall, author of Born to Run

Haruki Murakami,"Revue de presse
It’s an inspiring, reflective read that’ll make you want to dust your trainers off -- Andy McNicoll ― Professional Social Work

An outstanding read -- Peter Sharkey ― Eastern Daily Press
Quatrième de couverture
In 1982, having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing, Murakami began running to keep fit. A year later, he&#39d completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and on his writing.

Equal parts travelogue, training log, and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and settings ranging from Tokyo&#39s Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston.

By turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, this is a must-read for fans of this masterful yet private writer as well as for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.

Alexis Berg,"A glorious photographic record of the superhumans who have completed the Barkley Marathons, one of the most mythical running races on earth.

It is a race like no other: There is no website to take entries; participants are selected from those who find a way to submit written applications and a $1.60 entry fee; only around 40 people are chosen to run, with condolences from the race director. The course, based in the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee, takes place amid unforgiving landscapes and harsh vegetation, often in horrendous conditions with poor visibility. Runners must complete five 20-mile loops - those who manage to complete only three laps are deemed to have achieved the &#39fun run&#39 - with a total elevation climb equal to two ascents of Mount Everest. Since 1986, only 15 people have ever finished. This exceptional publication celebrates their unbelievable achievements.

Until relatively recently, the event was known only by true insiders, but with the increasing popularity of trail running and the race&#39s inaccessibility to anyone except the participants and a handful of media, it has attained mythical status.

Thanks to ultrarunning photographer Alexis Berg and L&#39Équipe journalist Aurélien Delfosse, we now have a record of these superhumans - many of whom are unknown in sporting circles - who have completed the race. Crisscrossing the United States to meet each finisher, Berg and Delfosse travelled from New Hampshire to Oregon via New Mexico, Colorado, California and Utah, capturing stunning photographs and in-depth interviews with the finishers. These stories inspire awe, respect and reflection at the limit of the human spirit.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/4p5l345145m53c52gfslhv8r7m._SY600_.jpg
