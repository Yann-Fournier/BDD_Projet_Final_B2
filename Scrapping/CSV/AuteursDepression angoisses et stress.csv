Meg Mason,"Revue de presse
This richly spiced novel is a pleasure from the first page to the last... Its beautifully understated, airy style conceals the fiercest intelligence. I loved it so much that I stalked the author on social media - a first. Just read it. It&#39s unforgettable. -- India Knight ― SUNDAY TIMES CULTURE

The most wonderful, heartbreakingly gorgeous novel of the year. -- Elizabeth Day ― THE MAIL ON SUNDAY, YOU MAGAZINE

It is impossible to read this novel and not be moved. It is also impossible not to laugh out loud... Mason pulls off something extraordinary in this huge-hearted novel, alchemising an unbearable anguish into something tender and hilarious and redemptive and wise, without ever undermining its gravity or diminishing its pain. -- Clare Clark ― GUARDIAN

Inspired storytelling... a devastating and sharply funny love story... it is Martha&#39s voice itself - her woeful deadpan narration always teetering between the comic, the tragic and the downright unlikable - that makes this novel sing. -- Julie Myerson ― OBSERVER

Probably the best book you&#39ll read this year... Brilliant, bleak, hilarious: the book of the summer. -- Natasha Poliszczuk ― THE MAIL ON SUNDAY

Sorrow and Bliss, Meg Mason&#39s first novel to be published in the UK, is as wonderful as everyone says it is. Blunt, tender, hilarious, and so very good on the trickiness of families, it is that rare perfect balance of fun (commercial) and difficult (literary), and exactly the book to read right now, when you need a laugh, but want to cry. -- Eva Wiseman ― THE OBSERVER MAGAZINE

Summer&#39s must-read novel... We can&#39t recommend Sorrow And Bliss highly enough. -- Francesca Brown ― STYLIST

A Fleabag-esque novel being raved about by Gillian Anderson and Ann Patchett... Expect this one to light up the WhatsApp chats. -- Louisa McGillicuddy ― SUNDAY TIMES STYLE

You know that book that only comes along every so often, that seems to unite everyone who has read it in a sort of delirious fervour? Sorrow and Bliss is that book... It&#39s utterly compelling and darkly funny: the book you have to read this summer. -- Jessie Thompson ― EVENING STANDARD

Meg Mason has achieved something remarkable - Sorrow and Bliss is a raucously funny, beautifully written, emotionbashing book about love, family and life&#39s curveballs that leaves you, satisfyingly, with what feels like wisdom forged in fire. -- Siobhan Murphy ― THE TIMES

This is a story of mental illness reflected through the prism of an uproarious, big-hearted family comedy. It is fiercely intelligent and absolutely sublime. -- Anne Cunningham ― IRISH INDEPENDENT

Rarely have the excoriating effects of mental illness been articulated quite so beautifully - as heartbreaking as it&#39s funny, Sorrow And Bliss is one for the keeper shelves. -- Sarra Manning ― RED MAGAZINE

Deeply moving but also darkly funny, Mason has created the sort of story that you savour the last pages of and long for once it&#39s over. -- Olivia Ovenden ― ESQUIRE

Completely brilliant, I loved it. I think every girl and woman should read it. ― Gillian Anderson

Sorrow and Bliss is a brilliantly faceted and extremely funny book about depression that engulfed me in the way I&#39m always hoping to be to be engulfed by novels. While I was reading it, I was making a list of all the people I wanted to send it to, until I realized that I wanted to send it to everyone I know. ― Ann Patchett

Sharp yet humane, and jaw-droppingly funny, this is the kind of novel you will want to press into the hands of everyone you know. Mason has an extraordinary talent for dialogue and character, and her understanding of how much poignancy a reader can take is profound. A masterclass on family, damage and the bonds of love: as soon as I finished it, I started again. ― Jessie Burton

Sorrow and Bliss is a thing of beauty. Astute observations on marriage, motherhood, family, and mental illness are threaded through a story that is by turns devastating and restorative. Every sentence rings true. I will be telling everyone I love to read this book. ― Sara Collins, author of THE CONFESSIONS OF FRANNIE LANGTON

A sharply observed, darkly hilarious and merciless portrait of a thoroughly messed-up family. Patrick Melrose meets Fleabag. Brilliant. ― Clare Chambers, author of SMALL PLEASURES

Meg Mason writes about the slow bleed of life-long depression with candour, humour and stark precision. Sorrow and Bliss is about what happens when your illness pushes everyone away - leaving you with only the sorest parts of yourself for company. It will, as the title suggests, shatter your heart, before mending it with infinite love. I&#39ve never read anything like it and will be pressing it into the hands of every reader I know. ― Pandora Sykes

Compulsively readable, Sorrow and Bliss is one of the funniest books I&#39ve read... Martha is such a brilliant, singular creation - as Patrick says, ""The idea that you might be ordinary is unbearable"" - that it is more interesting to imagine not the characters that have inspired her but the ones she will inspire. -- Francesca Steele ― I NEWSPAPER

Sharp, stylish and revelatory, this novel is sure to be one of the big success stories of the year. -- Sarah Gilmartin ― IRISH TIMES

Consistently funny and sharp and dark: it&#39s wonderful. ― Charlotte Mendelson, author of ALMOST ENGLISH

[A] razor-sharp exploration of mental health and identity. Hilarious and heartbreaking, this is best enjoyed over a large glass of rosé on a sunny afternoon. ― COSMOPOLITAN

The unforgettable novel you need to read this summer. ― TIMES BOOKS NEWSLETTER

I&#39ve never read a novel about the impact of mental illness on the life of a woman, and those around her, like this. It is simply brilliant, and Martha&#39s voice is a joy: hilarious, sharp and devastating. A must read. -- Alice O&#39Keefe ― THE BOOKSELLER, Editor&#39s Choice

Nina Stibbe meets Fleabag -- Charlotte Heathcote ― DAILY EXPRESS

Blisteringly good... a novel that manages to be psychologically complex, yet still an utter joy to read. Sorrow and Bliss bristles with great one-liners and setpieces that are sometimes alarming, sometimes comic, but more often both. ― READER&#39S DIGEST

Heartbreakingly sad and yet screamingly funny. -- Deirdre O&#39Brien ― BEST

I very much enjoyed Meg Mason&#39s witty, affecting Sorrow and Bliss. -- David Nicholls ― GUARDIAN - Hot Summer Books feature

This is a beautiful depiction of a marriage, with all of its ugliness and joy. But its also a brilliant depiction of a whole family, wounded by a legacy of mental illness, and tender, witty, and loving, in spite of it, So funny, and so very, very sad. ― Abigail Dean, bestselling author of GIRL A

An incredibly funny and devastating debut ... enlivened, often, by a madcap energy. Yet it still manages to be sensitive and heartfelt, and to offer a nuanced portrayal of what it means to try to make amends and change. ― Guardian

With its finger on the modern pulse, Sorrow and Bliss blisters with its prose which manages to be both hilarious and heartbreaking in the same line. I kept having to stop to underline sentences. It reminded me of a cross between Fleabag and My Year of Rest and Relaxation, but really, Meg Mason has crafted a protagonist who feels completely her own person. Fresh and alive. ― Jodie Chapman, author of ANOTHER LIFE

Sorrow and Bliss is a moving and poignant story about mental illness, family and love. It made me laugh and cry; a bittersweet read that will stay with you for a long time. ― Libby Page, bestselling author of The Lido

I devoured this book, with all its humour and pain and cock-eyed hope. It&#39s a funny and excruciating portrayal of mental illness, family dysfunction and love, all told through the point of view of a narrator who is in turn frustrating and endearing, but always fascinating. I adored it from the first page. ― Julie Cohen, author of TOGETHER

Sorrow and Bliss is hilarious, haunting, and utterly captivating. Meg Mason has created a heroine as prickly as Bernadette in Where&#39d You Go, Bernadette. Her humor is as arch and wise as the best work of Joan Didion and Rachel Cusk, yet completely original. What a thrilling new voice! ― Amanda Eyre Ward, New York Times bestselling author of THE JETSETTERS

Brutal, tender, funny, this novel - a portrait of love in all of its many incarnations - came alive for me from the very first page. I saw myself here. I saw the people I love. I am changed by this book. ― Mary Beth Keane, New York Times bestselling author of ASK AGAIN, YES

So dark, so funny, so true. You will see your sad, struggling, triumphant self in this deeply affecting novel ― Laura Zigman, author of SEPARATION ANXIETY

This is a romance, true, but a real one. It&#39s modern love up against the confusing, sad aches of mental illness, with all its highs, lows, humour and misery. Comparisons to Sally Rooney will be made, but Mason&#39s writing is less self-conscious than Rooney&#39s, and perhaps more mature. Her character work is outstanding, and poignant-the hairline fractures, contradictions and nuances of the middle-class family dynamic are painstakingly rendered with moving familiarity and black humour, resulting in a combination as devastating and sharply witty as Phoebe Waller-Bridge&#39s Fleabag. ― Bookseller+Publisher

Exploring the multifaceted hardships of mental illness and the frustrating inaccuracy of diagnoses, medications, and treatments, Sorrow and Bliss is darkly comic and deeply heartfelt. Much like the narrator of Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, Martha&#39s voice is acerbic, witty, and raw. Fans of Marian Keyes should put this on their to-read lists.
― Booklist

Martha&#39s anecdotes, simultaneously funny and sad, are stacked with observations that alternate between brutally cutting-especially when directed at her mother and at the patient and supportive Patrick-and aching, as when her oblique descriptions of her sister&#39s growing family increasingly belie her true feelings about motherhood. Witty and stark, Martha&#39s emotionally affecting story will delight fans of Sally Rooney. ― Publishers Weekly, Starred Review

Martha Friel, the narrator of this improbably charming novel about mental illness, will have you chortling and reading lines aloud. ― PEOPLE

Meg Mason has the ability to keep the reader alongside and sharing in the hope every step of the way. ― WOMAN & HOME

A sharp-eyed look at the impact of mental illness that&#39s heartbreaking but also bitterly funny. -- Jo Finney ― GOOD HOUSEKEEPING

Deliciously dark and fantastically funny. ― THE SUNDAY POST

Martha tells the sotry of the end of her marriage, her fiercely close relationship with her sister and her terrifying experiences of mental chaos in this brilliant, painful and unexpectedly comic novel. Narrated with insight and sensitivity by actor Emilia Fox, it looks set to become one of the hits of the year. -- Alex Clark ― FINANCIAL TIMES, Audio Books review round up

A viciously funny novel about mental illness that combines acute social satire with warmth and insight. -- Claire Allfree ― METRO

Without a doubt the book of the summer.By turns dryly funny and breathtakingly sad, it is a compulsive, exquisitely written look at mental illness and relationships. -- Gwendolyn Smith ― I NEWSPAPER - #1 pick in summer reading roud up

Brilliant, bleak and hysterically funny. Tackling mental illness, families, sisterly love and failing marriages... it&#39s universally being proclaimed ""The book of the summer"". -- Suzannah Ramsdale ― EVENING STANDARD

Meg Mason&#39s debut novel is tender and dark as a bruise, coloured with complicated emotions but also wryly funny. And, as it takes a candid look at the way mental illness can derail a person, it also brims with hope as Martha looks to the future, determined to pick up the pieces of her broken life. -- Eithne Farry ― SUNDAY EXPRESS S MAGAZINE

Unputdownable - one of the darkest, sharpest novels you will find this year. -- Nadine O&#39Regan ― THE SUNDAY BUSINESS POST

This debut from Meg Mason is a brilliant, many-faceted diamond of a book. ― SAINSBURY&#39S MAGAZINE

Martha Friel is one of those fictional characters that you can&#39t get out of your head... The moment we&#39d finished this dazzling, spiky, darkly funny book, we wanted to read it all over again. -- Emma Lee-Potter ― INDEPENDENT

The most recommended book of the summer, and with good reason. Meg Mason&#39s novel about mental health, marriage and sisterhood is told in a singular voice of wry wit and blackly comic frankness. One of those &#39read it in one sitting and tell all your friends&#39 kind of books. -- Jessie Thompson ― EVENING STANDARD, Best Fiction of 2021

It is a subtle and sensitive writer who can make you shout with laughter as she wrings your heart. Mason&#39s characters are exquisitely drawn. Sorrow, yes, but also utter bliss. -- Rose Shepherd ― SAGA

Must-read stuff: clever, sparkling and funny. ― STRONG WORDS

This account of a life derailed by mental illness is both darkly funny and deeply touching... A brilliantly faceted and funny book that will engulf you.
― BEST MONTHLY

It made me laugh and cry. I loved it so much - I need to read it again. ― Emilia Clarke

The summer of 2021&#39s most (justifiably) hyped novel... is a beautifully paced, darkly funny, heart-thuddingly moving portrait of family, marriage and chronic illness. Its pithy protagonist-narrator, Martha, is a memorable creation. -- Patricia Nicol ― THE SUNDAY TIMES, Best Fiction of the Year

Simply unforgettable. -- Francesca Steele ― I NEWSPAPER, Best Books of 2021

The summer&#39s word-of-mouth hit was Meg Mason&#39s Sorrow and Bliss (W&N), a wisecracking black comedy of mental anguish and eccentric family life focused on a woman who should have everything to live for. -- Justine Jordan ― GUARDIAN, Best Books of 2021

Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason is a knockout. An unnamed mental health illness and a struggling marriage are both rendered by Mason with devastating honesty and laugh-out-loud wit. -- Louise O&#39Neill ― IRISH EXAMINER
Quatrième de couverture
Everyone tells Martha Friel she is clever and beautiful, a brilliant writer who has been loved every day of her adult life by one man, her husband Patrick. A gift, her mother once said, not everybody gets.

So why is everything broken? Why is Martha - on the edge of 40 - friendless, practically jobless and so often sad? And why did Patrick decide to leave?

Maybe she is just too sensitive, someone who finds it harder to be alive than most people. Or maybe - as she has long believed - there is something wrong with her. Something that broke when a little bomb went off in her brain, at 17, and left her changed in a way that no doctor or therapist has ever been able to explain.

Forced to return to her childhood home to live with her dysfunctional, bohemian parents (but without the help of her devoted, foul-mouthed sister Ingrid), Martha has one last chance to find out whether a life is ever too broken to fix - or whether, maybe, by starting over, she will get to write a better ending for herself.

Ariane Seccia Boulanger,"Née en août 1956 à Marseille Ariane Seccia Boulanger obtient son diplôme de sage- femme en 1980. Ariane se consacre depuis plus de vingt-cinq ans au bien être des parents et de leurs enfants. Sa spécificité : la grossesse psychique et le travail sur les peurs autour de la naissance. C&#39est à la naissance de ses enfants, dont certains naissent dans des conditions difficiles, qu&#39elle prend conscience du véritable enjeu de la naissance, de la grossesse psychique et du danger de la sur-médicalisation. Pendant des années, elle va observer et tenter d&#39accompagner la grande souffrance des mères et des enfants qui ont mal vécu leur accouchement. Elle oriente de plus en plus sa recherche sur l&#39impact que peuvent avoir les stress et les peurs sur la grossesse, l&#39accouchement, le lien avec l&#39enfant, et au-delà l&#39avenir de la famille. Profondément convaincue de l&#39influence positive du vécu d&#39une naissance naturelle, elle s&#39investit aussi complètement dans les premiers projets de maisons de naissance. En parallèle, un travail de plusieurs années en décodage biologique et l&#39étayage de sa propre analyse lui donnent les clés nécessaires pour aller plus loin dans sa démarche dans l&#39abord de la grossesse psychique.

Johann Hari,"Aujourd&#39hui, la science a apporté la preuve que la dépression n&#39est pas provoquée par une baisse de la sérotonine ou par quelque déﬁcit chimique dans le cerveau. Pourtant nombre de médecins semblent l&#39ignorer.

«Chaque dépression» «a un sens» constitue le premier livre interdisciplinaire sur ce mal qui isole et qui tue : Johann Hari, essayiste en sciences sociales, prend en compte les résultats scientiﬁques non seulement de la médecine mais aussi des sciences sociales, de l&#39anthropologie et de la primatologie.

En rencontrant des chercheurs de plusieurs pays, en croisant leurs travaux, l&#39auteur a identiﬁé neuf causes de la dépression et de l&#39anxiété sévère - tout ce qui, dans nos vies, peut constituer un terreau propice à cette aﬄiction. Il invite à porter un regard neuf sur ceux qui en souﬀrent et partage sa découverte de traitements alternatifs et de soins non médicamenteux ayant fait leurs preuves.",

C.C. Atman,"C.C. Atman est un auteur français né en région parisienne qui a grandi auprès des forêts du Vexin durant la majeure partie de son enfance.
C’est là qu’il a effectué, sans le savoir, ses premiers pas de découverte de la Nature et de toute la liberté et l’indépendance qu’elle peut procurer, en particulier pour qui sait l’approcher.
Issu d’un milieu familial modeste et commun, il a suivi une scolarité traditionnelle, mais s’est néanmoins interrogé très tôt sur le sens de l’existence telle qu’elle lui était proposée, au point de rompre à plusieurs reprises avec la vie aisée dont il disposait.
La naissance de ses deux enfants, la vie routinière dans laquelle il s’enlisait, et peut-être aussi la mort prématurée de sa mère après un long cancer alors qu’elle venait tout juste d’être retraitée, l’ont poussé instinctivement à opérer le plus grand des « sauts de foi » comme il aime les appeler. Il vendit sa voiture, sa maison, quitta sa profession de cadre ainsi que le confort et la sécurité acquis, et partit ainsi à la découverte du plus grand terrain de jeu qui puisse attendre un humain : la planète Terre.
Accompagné seulement de son fils et de sa fille, alors âgés respectivement de dix et de huit ans, il se lança dans la quête ultime de renouer avec le plus haut état de bonheur qui puisse être vécu par un être humain.
Ce long voyage guida ses pas à travers tous les continents et de nombreux pays. De l’Inde aux Amériques, en passant par l’Asie et l’Océanie ; des déserts arides d’Australie aux jungles tropicales humides de Bornéo et ses dernières forêts primaires ; des barrières de corail du Pacifique, jusqu’aux plus hauts plateaux et montagnes des Andes et de l’Himalaya, chacun de ses pas l’a mené vers une multitude de rencontres et d’expériences uniques, mais aussi vers des enseignements millénaires venant de la Nature ou de l’Humanité.
Il partage cette richesse immatérielle depuis 2015 en consacrant sa vie à l’écriture d’essais et de romans inspirants.",

Matt Haig,"Like nearly one in five people, Matt Haig suffers from depression. Reasons to Stay Alive is Matt&#39s inspiring account of how, minute by minute and day by day, he overcame the disease with the help of reading, writing, and the love of his parents and his girlfriend (and now-wife), Andrea. And eventually, he learned to appreciate life all the more for it.

Everyone&#39s lives are touched by mental illness: if we do not suffer from it ourselves, then we have a friend or loved one who does. Matt&#39s frankness about his experiences is both inspiring to those who feel daunted by depression and illuminating to those who are mystified by it. Above all, his humor and encouragement never let us lose sight of hope. Speaking as his present self to his former self in the depths of depression, Matt is adamant that the oldest cliché is the truest--there is light at the end of the tunnel. He teaches us to celebrate the small joys and moments of peace that life brings, and reminds us that there are always reasons to stay alive.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/urdupbvd590pq3m51f8lguccth._SY600_.jpg

Baek Sehee,"The sequel to the Sunday Times and international-bestselling South Korean therapy memoir, translated by International Booker Prize-shortlisted Anton Hur

When Baek Sehee started recording her sessions with her psychiatrist, her hope was to create a reference for herself. She never imagined she would reach so many people, especially young people, with her reflections. I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki became a runaway bestseller in South Korea, Indonesia, and the U.S., and reached a community of readers who appreciated depression and anxiety being discussed with such intimacy.

Baek&#39s struggle with dysthymia continues in I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki. And healing is a difficult process; the inner conflict she experiences in treatment becomes more complex, more challenging. With this second book, Baek Sehee reaches out to hold the hands of all those for whom grappling with everyday despair is part of a lifelong project, part of the journey.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png
