Gisele Bündchen,"Introduction

Health is true wealth.

I have learned this the hard way.

My experiences have taught me that feeling good both mentally and physically is my greatest asset, because when life is difficult, it’s my health that holds me up. Being strong is something I am proud of and work hard at, and what I eat and how I eat affects my quality of life and my health more than almost anything else I do. I find happiness, contentment, and wellness through food, and I take so much satisfaction and joy in treating my body kindly. Eating nutritious food nourishes my body and feeds my soul.

When it comes to the food I love most, I turn to simplicity. I want all the benefits of real, nutritious food with no fillers or fake stuff. I also don’t want restrictions or complications from diets. Luckily, simple food—like fruits, vegetables, smoothies, occasional meat and fish—usually tastes best and is the easiest to prepare, too. Not to mention, it gives me joy. I don’t just eat to satisfy my hunger or for instant gratification—though of course both are happy by-products. Most important, I’ve found that eating simply provides me with happiness, health, energy, and well-being. This plus good sleep and a daily exercise routine improves my bodily functions, from easy digestion to physical strength to a clear mind. Food is the fuel that drives us. Eating delicious, organic, natural foods and sharing meals with my family where we all feel fully nourished and cared for are deeply meaningful to me. It makes me feel whole.

In life, you reap what you sow. If you give love, you will receive love. And if you eat well and take control of what you choose to put in your body, you will feel strong, mentally resilient, and comfortable in your own skin. But it’s a choice. It’s up to you. The consequences are yours alone, good or bad. Taking responsibility for my health changed my life, and I’m grateful for the courage and discipline it took to get to this point. Today I feel stronger than I ever did before. It was a long road to get here, but I’m so happy that here is where I am. I surround myself with positive energy. I am loving to myself. I really believe that we become what we think and what we eat.

Here is my story.

Pete Egoscue,"Extrait
INTRODUCTION

This is a book about our bodies—yours and mine. We are different in height, weight, and possibly gender. But our common possession is the body&#39s inner power to heal itself and to be pain free. By choosing those two words as my title, I am celebrating our mutual good fortune. I am also making a promise that I know you can keep.

Being pain free takes personal effort and commitment. It doesn&#39t come from a pill bottle, a surgeon&#39s knife, a brace, or in specially designed mattresses, chairs, and tools. The thousands of men and women who in the course of a typical year visit my Egoscue Method Clinic in San Diego, California, know it, or they soon find out, and I watch them transform their lives as they rediscover the joy and health that had seemed lost forever. While each client is dedicated to stopping chronic pain in one form or another, they are all taking the easy way out. The easiest, really.

The following pages show you the way. It does not involve high-tech medicine or elaborate physical therapy routines. You won&#39t need to buy special equipment or consult cadres of experts. In the first three chapters, I review how the human body is designed to maintain its own health throughout a long lifetime. Episodes of pain are aberrations that can be easily treated if the body is permitted to do its work. Unfortunately, many of us don&#39t understand even the most basic features of this magnificent ""machine.""

Following this overview are eight chapters, each dealing with a specific chronic pain condition. You have probably already looked at the table of contents. I reverse the usual order and go from foot to head: sore feet, ankles, knees, hips, back, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, neck, and head. The chronic pain chapters are set up to give you a quick and thorough briefing on what&#39s happening in that part of the body when it hurts. After each briefing, I offer a series of exercises designed to alleviate the causes of pain in that body part. My friends at the clinic have nicknamed them E-cises, for ""Egoscuecises,"" to tease me for my near obsession with fine-tuning them as therapeutic tools. What started as an inside joke has taken root, and that&#39s what I call them in this book. The E-cises are arranged in menus, and are easy to do and extremely effective. To guide you along, I provide detailed instructions and many photos.

Next comes a chapter on common chronic pain problems relating to popular sports and recreational activities, and finally a concluding chapter that, among other things, offers an overall conditioning menu of E-cises for your use once your chronic pain symptoms abate.

A Quick Guide to Using Pain Free

An author probably should not presume to tell a reader how to read a book, but I will risk it anyway in the interest of making this information as accessible as possible. My guess is that you are in pain or have been in pain recently. Take the time to read the first three chapters, which give you valuable background knowledge. I&#39ll explain how a serious deficiency of ""design motion"" is causing your chronic pain symptoms and how easy it is for you to remedy the situation. Then quickly flip through the rest of the chapters to get a look at the boxes and breakouts that present key concepts in capsule form. Finally, turn to the chapter that focuses on your specific condition. My hope is that you&#39ll eventually read the book straight through, but I realize that stopping the pain may be paramount in your mind. If I had to choose one additional must-read chapter, it would be chapter 7, which deals with hips. The condition of our hips plays a central role in combating chronic pain throughout the body.

I&#39ll take one more unusual liberty as an author by making this statement: Pain Free won&#39t do you much good if you just read it. Information is fine, but action is far better. When practiced both in the clinic and at home, the E-cises in this book yield a ninety-five percent success rate. Yet the Egoscue Method conquers chronic pain only because those who are suffering are empowered with the means to heal themselves—and they use that power. Those among the five percent who are unable to find relief using the Method often do not have the time or the inclination to take action; they do the E-cises sporadically or not at all.

I urge you to use the E-cises. They look simple, but they are calibrated to pinpoint specific musculoskeletal functions that have been compromised by a variety of factors. The E-cise menus are arranged sequentially to address each component of a particular chronic pain symptom. Therefore, you should do the menu in the order it is presented; by picking and choosing E-cises at random, you risk interrupting the sequence. Likewise, if you have active pain, do not shop around in this book for something you think might work. Stick with the menu for the body part where the chronic pain is occurring. If an E-cise is specified for one side of the body, always repeat it on the other side, even though it may be harder or—as is the case many times—it doesn&#39t seem relevant to the pain symptom.

I believe in goal setting and planning. When it comes to managing one&#39s health, the old maxim ""Those who do not plan, plan to fail"" is particularly true. Even so, people who wouldn&#39t dream of doing business or providing for their families until they had a clear set of objectives and a strategy for achieving them, make major health decisions without knowing what they want, how to realize it, and what the real costs will be.

With the Egoscue Method, I ask new clients what they expect to get for their money. Is it pain relief, enhanced athletic performance, or a good night&#39s sleep? There are many legitimate answers. In turn, I tell them what we can do, how much it will cost, how long it will take, and what they will be expected to do. If I don&#39t keep my end of the bargain, the client gets his or her money back. The guarantee is in play from the very first visit. If the client is hurting and doesn&#39t feel better on leaving, the visit is free.

Does this sound like buying an appliance from a reputable dealer, or laying out the terms of an important business deal? Comparisons like that couldn&#39t please me more. Any vendor of health care, mainstream or alternative, who isn&#39t willing to stand by the product must be treated with the utmost caution. They shouldn&#39t hide behind science, expertise, or complexity. If the tough questions aren&#39t asked, shame on you, the consumer; if they&#39re not answered, shame on us, the supplier. Ducking and dodging have the same universal meaning, whether the product comes with four worn tires and suspiciously low mileage or is bristling with terminology that no layperson can understand. As a consumer, the less you know, the more you should worry that the product may not work as advertised. Many common musculoskeletal treatments don&#39t work as advertised; that&#39s why patients find it so difficult to get straight answers to their questions, starting with ""Why does it hurt?"" They often get probablies, maybes, and chances ares. Even a direct answer to a question about the cause of joint pain—cartilage loss—smothers in a blanket of vagueness when patients ask a follow-up question: ""Why is there cartilage loss on the right side and not the left?"" When it comes to health care, it is imperative to ask and keep asking the same nuts-and-bolts questions that you would ask in any straightforward consumer transaction.

In addition to being grounded solidly in this consumer-knows-best philosophy, the Egoscue Method&#39s E-cises, by suppressing pain symptoms, eliminate impulses to buy products for which patients probably have no need in the first place. If a surgical procedure or drug regimen is designed to eliminate pain, but exercise therapy has already eliminated it, why bother with the surgery or drugs? ""Because,"" you&#39re likely to be told, ""the pain will return."" That&#39s correct, it will return. But the most basic question of all is, Why should it return? The answer lies at the heart of the entire Egoscue Method. Unless treatment addresses underlying musculoskeletal dysfunctions, pain relief can be only temporary. Nobody wants to hurt, and nobody should have to. But eliminating the pain symptom is only the first step. Without going to the next one, the muscles will continue to tell the bones to move in ways that violate the body&#39s design. That&#39s why the chronic pain will return.

The only product that&#39s worth investing in is a fully functional musculoskeletal system. It&#39s no luxury but rather a basic necessity that&#39s within everyone&#39s reach.
