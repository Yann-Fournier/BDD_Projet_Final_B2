Aristote,"Il n&#39y avait à ce jour que deux traductions disponibles de la Métaphysique d&#39Aristote en français. Celle de Jules Barthélémy Saint-Hilaire date de 1878. Il est évident que depuis sa parution beaucoup de travaux en codicologie, en paléographie et en philosophie ont amélioré notre connaissance du texte et notre compréhension de son contenu. La seconde traduction, celle de Jules Tricot, a paru en 1933, puis a été plusieurs fois rééditée, en particulier en 1964. Le traducteur déclare lui-même avoir voulu «rendre la pensée d&#39Aristote» plutôt que de s&#39astreindre à «une exactitude littérale». La présente traduction suit une méthode exactement opposée : elle se conforme rigoureusement au texte grec, tel qu&#39il est transmis par les manuscrits les plus anciens, pour tenter de saisir la pensée d&#39Aristote. Il est clair que la tâche n&#39en est pas simplifiée. Cependant l&#39évolution des connaissances philologiques et philosophiques autant que les exigences actuelles en matière de traduction montrent l&#39utilité de proposer une nouvelle version d&#39un texte rarement traduit.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1l++szv30S._SY600_.jpg

Mitch Albom,"Extrait
The Curriculum

The last class of my old professor&#39s life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves.  The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The subject was The Meaning of Life. It was taught from experience.  

No grades were given, but there were oral exams each week. You were expected to respond to questions, and you were expected to pose questions of your own. You were also required to perform physical tasks now and then, such as lifting the professor&#39s head to a comfortable spot on the pillow or placing his glasses on the bridge of his nose. Kissing him good-bye earned you extra credit.  

No books were required, yet many topics were covered, including love, work, community, family, aging, forgiveness, and, finally, death. The last lecture was brief, only a few words.  

A funeral was held in lieu of graduation.  

Although no final exam was given, you were expected to produce one long paper on what was learned. That paper is presented here.  

The last class of my old professor&#39s life had only one student.

I was the student.

It is the late spring of 1979, a hot, sticky Saturday afternoon. Hundreds of us sit together, side by side, in rows of wooden folding chairs on the main campus lawn. We wear blue nylon robes. We listen impatiently to long speeches. When the ceremony is over, we throw our caps in the air, and we are officially graduated from college, the senior class of Brandeis University in the city of Waltham, Massachusetts. For many of us, the curtain has just come down on childhood.  

Afterward, I find Morrie Schwartz, my favorite professor, and introduce him to my parents. He is a small man who takes small steps, as if a strong wind could, at any time, whisk him up into the clouds. In his graduation day robe, he looks like a cross between a biblical prophet and a Christmas elf. He has sparkling blue-green eyes, thinning silver hair that spills onto his forehead, big ears, a triangular nose, and tufts of graying eyebrows. Although his teeth are crooked and his lower ones are slanted back--as if someone had once punched them in--when he smiles it&#39s as if you&#39d just told him the first joke on earth.  

He tells my parents how I took every class he taught.  He tells them, ""You have a special boy here.""  Embarrassed, I look at my feet. Before we leave, I hand my professor a present, a tan briefcase with his initials on the front. I bought this the day before at a shopping mall.  I didn&#39t want to forget him. Maybe I didn&#39t want him to forget me.  

    ""Mitch, you are one of the good ones,"" he says, admiring the briefcase. Then he hugs me. I feel his thin arms around my back. I am taller than he is, and when he holds me, I feel awkward, older, as if I were the parent and he were the child.  

He asks if I will stay in touch, and without hesitation I say, ""Of course.""  

When he steps back, I see that he is crying.

The Syllabus

His death sentence came in the summer of 1994. Looking back, Morrie knew something bad was coming long before that. He knew it the day he gave up dancing.  

He had always been a dancer, my old professor. The music didn&#39t matter. Rock and roll, big band, the blues. He loved them all. He would close his eyes and with a blissful smile begin to move to his own sense of rhythm. It wasn&#39t always pretty. But then, he didn&#39t worry about a partner.  Morrie danced by himself.  

He used to go to this church in Harvard Square every Wednesday night for something called ""Dance Free.""  They had flashing lights and booming speakers and Morrie would wander in among the mostly student crowd, wearing a white T-shirt and black sweatpants and a towel around his neck, and whatever music was playing, that&#39s the music to which he danced. He&#39d do the lindy to Jimi Hendrix. He twisted and twirled, he waved his arms like a conductor on amphetamines, until sweat was dripping down the middle of his back. No one there knew he was a prominent doctor of sociology, with years of experience as a college professor and several well-respected books.  They just thought he was some old nut.  

Once, he brought a tango tape and got them to play it over the speakers. Then he commandeered the floor, shooting back and forth like some hot Latin lover. When he finished, everyone applauded. He could have stayed in that moment forever.  

But then the dancing stopped.  

He developed asthma in his sixties. His breathing became labored. One day he was walking along the Charles River, and a cold burst of wind left him choking for air. He was rushed to the hospital and injected with Adrenalin.  

A few years later, he began to have trouble walking.  At a birthday party for a friend, he stumbled inexplicably.  Another night, he fell down the steps of a theater, startling a small crowd of people.  

    ""Give him air!"" someone yelled.  

He was in his seventies by this point, so they whispered ""old age"" and helped him to his feet. But Morrie, who was always more in touch with his insides than the rest of us, knew something else was wrong. This was more than old age. He was weary all the time. He had trouble sleeping. He dreamt he was dying.  

He began to see doctors. Lots of them. They tested his blood. They tested his urine. They put a scope up his rear end and looked inside his intestines. Finally, when nothing could be found, one doctor ordered a muscle biopsy, taking a small piece out of Morrie&#39s calf. The lab report came back suggesting a neurological problem, and Morrie was brought in for yet another series of tests. In one of those tests, he sat in a special seat as they zapped him with electrical current--an electric chair, of sorts--and studied his neurological responses.  

    ""We need to check this further,"" the doctors said, looking over his results.  

    ""Why?"" Morrie asked. ""What is it?""  

    ""We&#39re not sure. Your times are slow.""  

His times were slow? What did that mean?  

Finally, on a hot, humid day in August 1994, Morrie and his wife, Charlotte, went to the neurologist&#39s office, and he asked them to sit before he broke the news: Morrie had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Lou Gehrig&#39s disease, a brutal, unforgiving illness of the neurological system.  

There was no known cure.  

    ""How did I get it?"" Morrie asked.  

Nobody knew.  

    ""Is it terminal?""  

Yes.  

    ""So I&#39m going to die?""  

Yes, you are, the doctor said. I&#39m very sorry.  

He sat with Morrie and Charlotte for nearly two hours, patiently answering their questions. When they left, the doctor gave them some information on ALS, little pamphlets, as if they were opening a bank account.  Outside, the sun was shining and people were going about their business. A woman ran to put money in the parking meter. Another carried groceries. Charlotte had a million thoughts running through her mind: How much time do we have left? How will we manage? How will we pay the bills?  

My old professor, meanwhile, was stunned by the normalcy of the day around him. Shouldn&#39t the world stop? Don&#39t they know what has happened to me?  

But the world did not stop, it took no notice at all, and as Morrie pulled weakly on the car door, he felt as if he were dropping into a hole.  

Now what? he thought.

As my old professor searched for answers, the disease took him over, day by day, week by week. He backed the car out of the garage one morning and could barely push the brakes. That was the end of his driving.  

He kept tripping, so he purchased a cane. That was the end of his walking free.  

He went for his regular swim at the YMCA, but found he could no longer undress himself. So he hired his first home care worker--a theology student named Tony--who helped him in and out of the pool, and in and out of his bathing suit. In the locker room, the other swimmers pretended not to stare. They stared anyhow.  That was the end of his privacy.  

In the fall of 1994, Morrie came to the hilly Brandeis campus to teach his final college course. He could have skipped this, of course. The university would have understood. Why suffer in front of so many people? Stay at home. Get your affairs in order. But the idea of quitting did not occur to Morrie.  

Instead, he hobbled into the classroom, his home for more than thirty years. Because of the cane, he took a while to reach the chair. Finally, he sat down, dropped his glasses off his nose, and looked out at the young faces who stared back in silence.  

    ""My friends, I assume you are all here for the Social Psychology class. I have been teaching this course for twenty years, and this is the first time I can say there is a risk in taking it, because I have a fatal illness. I may not live to finish the semester.  

    ""If you feel this is a problem, I understand if you wish to drop the course.""  

He smiled.  

And that was the end of his secret.

ALS is like a lit candle: it melts your nerves and leaves your body a pile of wax. Often. it begins with the legs and works its way up. You lose control of your thigh muscles, so that you cannot support yourself standing.  You lose control of your trunk muscles, so that you cannot sit up straight. By the end, if you are still alive, you are breathing through a tube in a hole in your throat, while your soul, perfectly awake, is imprisoned inside a limp husk, perhaps able to blink, or cluck a tongue, like something from a science fiction movie, the man frozen inside his own flesh. This takes no more than five years from the day you contract the disease.  

Morrie&#39s doctors guessed he had two years left.  

Morrie knew it was less.  

But my old professor had made a profound decision, one he began to construct the day he came out of the doctor&#39s office with a sword hanging over his head. Do I wither up and disappear, or do I make the best of my time left? he had asked himself.  

He would not wither. He would not be ashamed of dying.  

Instead, he would make death his final project, the center point of his days. Since everyone was going to die, he could be of great value, right? He could be research. A human textbook. Study me in my slow and patient demise.  Watch what happens to me. Learn with me.  

Morrie would walk that final bridge between life and death, and narrate the trip.  

The fall semester passed quickly. The pills increased.  Therapy became a regular routine. Nurses came to his house to work with Morrie&#39s withering legs, to keep the muscles active, bending them back and forth as if pumping water from a well. Massage specialists came by once a week to try to soothe the constant, heavy stiffness he felt. He met with meditation teachers, and closed his eyes and narrowed his thoughts until his world shrunk down to a single breath, in and out, in and out.  

One day, using his cane, he stepped onto the curb and fell over into the street. The cane was exchanged for a walker. As his body weakened, the back and forth to the bathroom became too exhausting, so Morrie began to urinate into a large beaker. He had to support himself as he did this, meaning someone had to hold the beaker while Morrie filled it.  

Most of us would be embarrassed by all this, especially at Morrie&#39s age. But Morrie was not like most of us. When some of his close colleagues would visit, he would say to them, ""Listen, I have to pee. Would you mind helping? Are you okay with that?""  

Often, to their own surprise, they were.  

In fact, he entertained a growing stream of visitors. He had discussion groups about dying, what it really meant, how societies had always been afraid of it without necessarily understanding it. He told his friends that if they really wanted to help him, they would treat him not with sympathy but with visits, phone calls, a sharing of their problems--the way they had always shared their problems, because Morrie had always been a wonderful listener.  

For all that was happening to him, his voice was strong and inviting, and his mind was vibrating with a million thoughts. He was intent on proving that the word ""dying"" was not synonymous with ""useless.""  

The New Year came and went. Although he never said it to anyone, Morrie knew this would be the last year of his life. He was using a wheelchair now, and he was fighting time to say all the things he wanted to say to all the people he loved. When a colleague at Brandeis died suddenly of a heart attack, Morrie went to his funeral. He came home depressed.  

    ""What a waste,"" he said. ""All those people saying all those wonderful things, and Irv never got to hear any of it.""  

Morrie had a better idea. He made some calls. He chose a date. And on a cold Sunday afternoon, he was joined in his home by a small group of friends and family for a ""living funeral."" Each of them spoke and paid tribute to my old professor. Some cried. Some laughed. One woman read a poem:

""My dear and loving cousin ...
      Your ageless heart
      as you move through time, layer on layer,
      tender sequoia ...""

Morrie cried and laughed with them. And all the heartfelt things we never get to say to those we love, Morrie said that day. His ""living funeral"" was a rousing success.  

Only Morrie wasn&#39t dead yet.  

  In fact, the most unusual part of his life was about to unfold.

Peter Adamson,"Accessible and comprehensive. ― Alban McCoy, The Tablet, Books of the Year 2019

Peter Adamson&#39s Medieval Philosophy gives fantastically compendious account of medieval philosophy. Adamson manages to be accessible, lucid, witty, incisive; luminously conveying the rambunctious ambivalences of the logic-chopping, devout, doubting, bawdy, bloodthirsty, mystical medievals. ― Jane O&#39Grady, The Tablet

a volume that― despite its weight and heft―one could easily give to a non-philosopher as a first introduction to the field. For even the most obscure authors (such as that most prolific of medieval philosophers, Anon) and the most arcane of topics comes to life under Adamson&#39s magic touch. But what is most impressive about the book is its sheer scope of knowledge. . . . If you want a good, light-touch, yet still not glossing over the difficulties, introduction to medieval philosophy, this is the book for you. ― Sara L. Uckelman, Philosophical Quarterly

Adamson&#39s history of medieval philosophy has, among its many merits, two great ones. First, is very clearly written and philosophically acute. . . .A second merit is that it proposes an updated interpretation of medieval philosophy, obtained by taking into account the most dominant trends present in literature. This makes Peter Adamson&#39s volume a fine piece of work and a recommended volume. The history of medieval philosophy is investigated in its depth and full development, no significant gap can be found indeed in the proposed reconstruction. ― Fabrizio Amerini, Philosophical Inquiries

Let me say at once on the evidence of this volume, [Adamson] succeeds brilliantly. Over some 78 sections he covers a huge range of figures ... Special attention is given - and rightly so - to female philosophers, such as Catherine of Siena ... This book (and the others in the series), which are a delight to read, will be of great interest to general readers, aside from students of culture. ― Peter Costello, The Irish Catholic

Adamson writes with a light style, beginning each short chapter with an anecdote, which rewards both sticking with the long narrative and dipping in and out. ― Nick Mattiske, Journey, Isolation Reading Recommendations

A staggering philosophical achievement ... the clarity of the animated text is further enhanced by the authors humour, bringing a light touch to complex matters ... This volume will surely attain classic status, and can be read either sequentially or consulted as a detailed encyclopaedia of mediaeval philosophy and its variegated personalities. ― Paradigm Explorer",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Il en vient ainsi à revisiter les moments qui conditionnent un tel parcours, démontage du fantasme d’une part, repositionnement du Nom-du-Père d’autre part.
La vérification de cette issue implique que l’analysé soit délesté du surmoi, qu’il ait déjoué les artefacts magiques et religieux, et qu’il se soit départi du « je n’en veux rien savoir » dont la science voudrait faire son credo.

Elle présente aussi la particularité d’avoir, au sens propre, les pieds sur terre et la tête dans les étoiles, ce qui lui permet d’être une intermédiaire entre les mondes.
Léna se considère comme l’un de ces êtres de « l’équipe au sol », venus par amour accompagner l’ascension vers le nouveau monde qui nous tend la main. Elle facilite la réception, l’assimilation de l’énergie de lumière qui arrive en cette période, ainsi que la décristallisation des blocages énergétiques. Cela s’opère lors de séances de canalisation, de libération énergétique et de reconnexion à soi, d’accompagnements en groupe et de causeries. Pour l’accompagnement individuel, elle travaille principalement à distance, avec des personnes se trouvant en France ou ailleurs.
Cette accompagnatrice intervient également lors de communications avec les défunts, afin de faciliter leur passage vers l’autre monde. Elle contribue à la libération des blocages restés en suspens en permettant la libération des non-dits, notamment avec les proches.
Lena ne prédit pas l’avenir. Elle rappelle souvent que chacun de nous l’écrit, que seul l’instant présent existe.

R. Lanier Anderson,"I want to emphasize that this is an extraordinarily rich book, and I&#39ve been able to discuss only a few central aspects of it. It is also clearly and engagingly written . . . I highly recommend the book, not only to Kant scholars but also to those interested in the history of the analytic/synthetic distinction as well as the history of German rationalism more generally. ― Colin McLear, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews

There is much to admire in this book, and much to learn from it. On interpretive, philosophical, and meta-philosophical levels, it is a major accomplishment and richly deserves the attention it will no doubt receive for many years to come. ― Robert Pippin, The New Rambler",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png
Peter Van Inwagen,"Praise for the fourth edition:

""It is very challenging to present the ideas and arguments of metaphysics in a way that undergraduates can follow, but van Inwagen not only does so with perspicuity, but also with great insight and rigor.""
Gordon Pettit, Western Illinois University

""The exposition throughout is a model of clarity, and it is remarkable how much ground is covered. There is a precision and efficiency of expression that is impressive. Metaphysics is a first-rate text, and the author is a master of the field.""
Jenann Ismael, University of Arizona

Metaphysics is a very helpful introduction to a difficult area in philosophy, and any library that does not have this book should get it. . . . the clarity of the writing makes this volume extremely useful to advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and those faculty who are interested in these issues but have only a passing acquaintance with them. Highly recommended.” Choice

Justin Clarke-Doane,"Review from previous edition Morality and Mathematics is an outstanding achievement and will be a standard point of reference for future work on the topics of which it treats. ― Hallvard Lillehammer, International Journal for the Study of Skepticism

Clarke-Doane ... brings remarkable expertise and ... research to [this project]. The main argument [is] copiously defended in this lucid but highly technical treatise. ... Underlying [the argument] is the important distinction between realism and objectivity.
― Sheila Mason, CHOICE

Clarke-Doane&#39s book offers a coherent and plausible set of answers to the notorious epistemological questions provoked by morality, and to the analogous questions that are provoked by mathematics. It is striking for its creativity, its rigorous arguments, its many subtle but important distinctions, its unusual breadth of expertise (covering the philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mathematics, and meta-ethics), and its rational control of a daunting battery of interacting considerations from these various branches of the subject. Exceptionally impressive philosophical talent and maturity are on display here. Needless to say, we probably haven&#39t yet been given the final truth about these matters. But it&#39s certain that anyone aiming to do better will have to grapple with Clarke-Doane&#39s formidable arguments and conclusions. ― Paul Horwich, New York University

Justin Clarke-Doane raises fascinating and important issues about evolutionary debunking arguments. He argues that insofar as our knowledge of the evolutionary origins of morality poses a challenge for moral realism, exactly similar difficulties will arise for mathematical realism. ― Matthew Braddock, Andreas Mogensen, and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, PEASoup

Clarke-Doane&#39s overarching metaphilosophical conclusion ... is ... that across a large range of philosophical debates ... the real philosophical questions are not metaphysical ... but practical, about which concepts to use. ... [W]e are left with a purely practical question of which framework to pick, which cannot itself be justified by appeal to more normativity. ...[P]erhaps a monist response can be afforded via an adaptation of Quine&#39s response to Carnap. ... But whether or not this response ... can be made to fly, Clarke-Doane&#39s achievement ... is substantial. ... [I]ncreased specialization makes serious engagement across subfields of philosophy a challenge. Morality and Mathematics rises to this challenge, and will serve as a springboard to further serious engagement across the subdisciplines
― Mary Leng, Mind

This excellent book ... compares morality and mathematics. Their similarities and differences are not what one might naively supposee, as the author demonstrates. The book is highly recommended to philosophers interested in both subjects, and to anyone who seeks a global understanding of how morality and mathematics fit into our belief system. ... The idea that practical questions alone resist deflation in the face of pluralist ... realism ... facilitated by the tension between realism and objectivity ... mak[es] ... for a rather striking metaphilosophical vision.
― Michael Bevan & Alexander Paseau, Philosophia Mathematica

In this brilliantly original book, Justin Clarke-Doane ... has upended many long-held views on morality and mathematics. ... Accept it or reject it, it manifests Clarke-Doane&#39s extraordinary combination of philosophical imagination and logical skill, and what I have discussed in this review is only a small sample of the philosophical gold to be found in his book.
