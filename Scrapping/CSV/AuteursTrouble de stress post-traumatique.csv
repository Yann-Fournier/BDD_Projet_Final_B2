Oprah Winfrey,"Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain development and trauma expert, Dr Bruce Perry, discuss the impact of trauma and adverse experiences and how healing must begin with a shift to asking &#39What happened to you?&#39 rather than &#39What’s wrong with you?&#39.

Through wide-ranging and often deeply personal conversation, Oprah Winfrey and Dr Perry explore how what happens to us in early childhood – both good and bad - influences the people we become. They challenge us to shift from focusing on &#39What’s wrong with you?&#39 or &#39Why are you behaving that way?&#39 to asking &#39What happened to you?&#39. This simple change in perspective can open up a new and hopeful understanding for millions about why we do the things we do, why we are the way we are, providing a road map for repairing relationships, overcoming what seems insurmountable, and ultimately living better and more fulfilling lives.

Many of us experience adversity and trauma during childhood that has lasting impact on our physical and emotional health. And as we’re beginning to understand, we are more sensitive to developmental trauma as children than we are as adults. ‘What happened to us’ in childhood is a powerful predictor of our risk for physical and mental health problems down the road, and offers scientific insights into the patterns of behaviours so many struggle to understand.

A survivor of multiple childhood challenges herself, Oprah Winfrey shares portions of her own harrowing experiences because she understands the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma at a young age. Throughout her career, Oprah has teamed up with Dr Bruce Perry, one of the world’s leading experts on childhood trauma. He has treated thousands of children, youth, and adults and has been called on for decades to support individuals and communities following high-profile traumatic events. Now, Oprah joins forces with Dr Perry to marry the power of storytelling with the science and clinical experience to better understand and overcome the effects of trauma.

Grounded in the latest brain science and brought to life through compelling narratives, this book shines a light on a much-needed path to recovery – showing us our incredible capacity to transform after adversity.ines a light on a much-needed path to recovery – showing us our incredible capacity to transform after adversity.",

Chapter 1

Traumas Lost and Found

The past is never dead. It&#39s not even past.

-William Faulkner, Requiem for a Nun

A well-documented feature of trauma, one familiar to many, is our inability to articulate what happens to us. Not only do we lose our words, but something happens with our memory as well. During a traumatic incident, our thought processes can become scattered and disorganized in such a way that we no longer recognize the memories as belonging to the original event. Instead, fragments of memory, dispersed as images, body sensations, and words, are stored in our unconscious and can become activated later by anything even remotely reminiscent of the original experience. Once they are triggered, it is as if an invisible rewind button has been pressed, causing us to reenact aspects of the original trauma in our day-to-day lives. Unconsciously, we could find ourselves reacting to certain people, events, or situations in old, familiar ways that echo the past.

Sigmund Freud identified this pattern more than one hundred years ago. Traumatic reenactment, or ""repetition compulsion,"" as Freud called it, is an attempt of the unconscious to replay what&#39s unresolved, so we can ""get it right."" This unconscious drive to relive past events could be one of the mechanisms at work when families repeat unresolved traumas in future generations.

Freud&#39s contemporary Carl Jung also believed that what remains unconscious does not dissolve but, rather, resurfaces in our lives as fate or fortune. Whatever is not conscious, he said, will be experienced as fate. In other words, we&#39re likely to keep repeating our unconscious patterns until we bring them into the light of awareness. Both Jung and Freud noted that whatever is too difficult to process does not fade away on its own but, rather, is stored in our unconscious.

Freud and Jung each observed how fragments of previously blocked, suppressed, or repressed life experience would show up in the words, gestures, and behaviors of their patients. For decades to follow, therapists would see such clues as slips of the tongue, accident patterns, or dream images as messengers shining a light into the unspeakable and unthinkable regions of their clients&#39 lives.

Recent advances in imaging technology have allowed researchers to unravel the brain and bodily functions that ""misfire"" or break down during overwhelming episodes. Bessel van der Kolk is a Dutch psychiatrist known for his research on posttraumatic stress. He explains that during a trauma, the speech center shuts down, as does the medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for experiencing the present moment. He describes the speechless terror of trauma as the experience of being at a loss for words, a common occurrence when brain pathways of remembering are hindered during periods of threat or danger. ""When people relive their traumatic experiences,"" he says, ""the frontal lobes become impaired and, as [a] result, they have trouble thinking and speaking. They no longer are capable of communicating to either themselves or to others precisely what&#39s going on.""

Still, all is not silent: words, images, and impulses that fragment following a traumatic event reemerge to form a secret language of our suffering we carry with us. Nothing is lost. The pieces have just been rerouted.

Emerging trends in psychotherapy are now beginning to point beyond the traumas of the individual to include traumatic events in the family and social history as a part of the whole picture. Tragedies varying in type and intensity-such as abandonment, suicide, and war, or the early death of a child, parent, or sibling-can send shock waves of distress cascading from one generation to the next. Recent developments in the fields of cellular biology, neuroscience, epigenetics, and developmental psychology underscore the importance of exploring at least three generations of family history in order to understand the mechanism behind patterns of trauma and suffering that repeat.

The following story offers a vivid example. When I first met Jesse, he hadn&#39t had a full night&#39s sleep in more than a year. His insomnia was evident in the dark shadows around his eyes, but the blankness of his stare suggested a deeper story. Though only twenty, Jesse looked at least ten years older. He sank onto my sofa as if his legs could no longer bear his weight.

Jesse explained that he had been a star athlete and a straight-A student, but that his persistent insomnia had initiated a downward spiral of depression and despair. As a result, he dropped out of college and had to forfeit the baseball scholarship he&#39d worked so hard to win. He desperately sought help to get his life back on track. Over the past year, he&#39d been to three doctors, two psychologists, a sleep clinic, and a naturopathic physician. Not one of them, he related in a monotone, was able to offer any real insight or help. Jesse, gazing mostly at the floor as he shared his story, told me he was at the end of his rope.

When I asked whether he had any ideas about what might have triggered his insomnia, he shook his head. Sleep had always come easily for Jesse. Then, one night just after his nineteenth birthday, he woke suddenly at 3:30 a.m. He was freezing, shivering, unable to get warm no matter what he tried. Three hours and several blankets later, Jesse was still wide awake. Not only was he cold and tired, he was seized by a strange fear he had never experienced before, a fear that something awful could happen if he let himself fall back to sleep. If I go to sleep, I&#39ll never wake up. Every time he felt himself drifting off, the fear would jolt him back into wakefulness. The pattern repeated itself the next night, and the night after that. Soon insomnia became a nightly ordeal. Jesse knew his fear was irrational, yet he felt helpless to put an end to it.

I listened closely as Jesse spoke. What stood out for me was one unusual detail-he&#39d been extremely cold, ""freezing,"" he said, just prior to the first episode. I began to explore this with Jesse, and asked him if anyone on either side of the family suffered a trauma that involved being cold, or being asleep, or being nineteen.

Jesse revealed that his mother had only recently told him about the tragic death of his father&#39s older brother-an uncle he never knew he had. Uncle Colin was only nineteen when he froze to death checking power lines in a storm just north of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Tracks in the snow revealed that he had been struggling to hang on. Eventually, he was found facedown in a blizzard, having lost consciousness from hypothermia. His death was such a tragic loss that the family never spoke his name again.

Now, three decades later, Jesse was unconsciously reliving aspects of Colin&#39s death-specifically, the terror of letting go into unconsciousness. For Colin, letting go meant death. For Jesse, falling asleep must have felt the same.

Making the connection was a turning point for Jesse. Once he grasped that his insomnia had its origin in an event that had occurred thirty years earlier, he finally had an explanation for his fear of falling asleep. The process of healing could now begin. With tools Jesse learned in our work together, which will be detailed later in this book, he was able to disentangle himself from the trauma endured by an uncle he&#39d never met, but whose terror he had unconsciously taken on as his own. Not only did Jesse feel freed from the heavy fog of insomnia, he gained a deeper sense of connection to his family, present and past.

In an attempt to explain stories such as Jesse&#39s, scientists are now able to identify biological markers-evidence that traumas can and do pass down from one generation to the next. Rachel Yehuda, professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, is one of the world&#39s leading experts in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a true pioneer in this field. In numerous studies, Yehuda has examined the neurobiology of PTSD in Holocaust survivors and their children. Her research on cortisol in particular (the stress hormone that helps our body return to normal after we experience a trauma) and its effects on brain function has revolutionized the understanding and treatment of PTSD worldwide. (People with PTSD relive feelings and sensations associated with a trauma despite the fact that the trauma occurred in the past. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, numbness, insomnia, nightmares, frightening thoughts, and being easily startled or ""on edge."")

Yehuda and her team found that children of Holocaust survivors who had PTSD were born with low cortisol levels similar to their parents&#39, predisposing them to relive the PTSD symptoms of the previous generation. Her discovery of low cortisol levels in people who experience an acute traumatic event has been controversial, going against the long-held notion that stress is associated with high cortisol levels. Specifically, in cases of chronic PTSD, cortisol production can become suppressed, contributing to the low levels measured in both survivors and their children.

Yehuda discovered similar low cortisol levels in war veterans, as well as in pregnant mothers who developed PTSD after the World Trade Center attacks, and in their children. Not only did she find that the survivors in her study produced less cortisol, a characteristic they can pass on to their children, she notes that several stress-related psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, chronic pain syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome, are associated with low blood levels of cortisol. Interestingly, 50 to 70 percent of PTSD patients also meet the diagnostic criteria for major depression or another mood or anxiety disorder.

Yehuda&#39s research demonstrates that you and I are three times more likely to experience symptoms of PTSD if one of our parents had PTSD, and as a result, we&#39re likely to suffer from depression or anxiety. She believes that this type of generational PTSD is inherited rather than occurring from our being exposed to our parents&#39 stories of their ordeals. Yehuda was one of the first researchers to show how descendants of trauma survivors carry the physical and emotional symptoms of traumas they have not directly experienced.

That was the case with Gretchen. After years of taking antidepressants, attending talk and group therapy sessions, and trying various cognitive approaches to mitigating the effects of stress, her symptoms of depression and anxiety remained unchanged.

Gretchen told me she no longer wanted to live. For as long as she could remember, she had struggled with emotions so intense she could barely contain the surges in her body. Gretchen had been admitted several times to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as bipolar with a severe anxiety disorder. Medication brought her slight relief, but never touched the powerful suicidal urges that lived inside her. As a teenager, she would self-injure by burning herself with the lit end of a cigarette. Now, at thirty-nine, Gretchen had had enough. Her depression and anxiety, she said, had prevented her from ever marrying and having children. In a surprisingly matter-of-fact tone of voice, she told me that she was planning to commit suicide before her next birthday.

Listening to Gretchen, I had the strong sense that there must be significant trauma in her family history. In such cases, I find it&#39s essential to pay close attention to the words being spoken for clues to the traumatic event underlying a client&#39s symptoms.

When I asked her how she planned to kill herself, Gretchen said that she was going to ""vaporize"" herself. As incomprehensible as it might sound to most of us, her plan was literally to leap into a vat of molten steel at the mill where her brother worked. ""My body will incinerate in seconds,"" she said, staring directly into my eyes, ""even before it reaches the bottom.""

I was struck by her lack of emotion as she spoke. Whatever feeling lay beneath appeared to have been vaulted deep inside. At the same time, the words vaporize and incinerate rattled inside me. Having worked with many children and grandchildren whose families were affected by the Holocaust, I&#39ve learned to let their words lead me. I wanted Gretchen to tell me more.

I asked if anyone in her family was Jewish or had been involved in the Holocaust. Gretchen started to say no, but then stopped herself and recalled a story about her grandmother. She had been born into a Jewish family in Poland, but converted to Catholicism when she came to the United States in 1946 and married Gretchen&#39s grandfather. Two years earlier, her grandmother&#39s entire family had perished in the ovens at Auschwitz. They had literally been gassed-engulfed in poisonous vapors-and incinerated. No one in Gretchen&#39s immediate family ever spoke to her grandmother about the war, or about the fate of her siblings or her parents. Instead, as is often the case with such extreme trauma, they avoided the subject entirely.

Gretchen knew the basic facts of her family history, but had never connected it to her own anxiety and depression. It was clear to me that the words she used and the feelings she described didn&#39t originate with her, but had in fact originated with her grandmother and the family members who lost their lives.

As I explained the connection, Gretchen listened intently. Her eyes widened and color rose in her cheeks. I could tell that what I said was resonating. For the first time, Gretchen had an explanation for her suffering that made sense to her.

To help her deepen her new understanding, I invited her to imagine standing in her grandmother&#39s shoes, represented by a pair of foam rubber footprints that I placed on the carpet in the center of my office. I asked her to imagine feeling what her grandmother might have felt after having lost all her loved ones. Taking it even a step further, I asked her if she could literally stand on the footprints as her grandmother, and feel her grandmother&#39s feelings in her own body. Gretchen reported sensations of overwhelming loss and grief, aloneness and isolation. She also experienced the profound sense of guilt that many survivors feel, the sense of remaining alive after loved ones have been killed.

In order to process trauma, it&#39s often helpful for clients to have a direct experience of the feelings and sensations that have been submerged in the body. When Gretchen was able to access these sensations, she realized that her wish to annihilate herself was deeply entwined with her lost family members. She also realized that she had taken on some element of her grandmother&#39s desire to die. As Gretchen absorbed this understanding, seeing the family story in a new light, her body began to soften, as if something inside her that had long been coiled up could now relax.

As with Jesse, Gretchen&#39s recognition that her trauma lay buried in her family&#39s unspoken history was merely the first step in her healing process. An intellectual understanding by itself is rarely enough for a lasting shift to occur. Often, the awareness needs to be accompanied by a deeply felt visceral experience. We&#39ll explore further the ways in which healing becomes fully integrated so that the wounds of previous generations can finally be released.

“Referencing many other body-oriented practices, therapists, and researchers, this book offers an up-to-date, pragmatic method of working somatically with people: a methodology which other psychotherapists—especially those from non-somatic disciplines—can readily learn from.”
—Courtenay Young, UK body psychotherapist, editor of the International Journal of Psychotherapy

“Susan McConnell writes from her heart and her embodied experience, as a counselor and an explorer in the somatic world. This book is an expression of her whole life and career, and yet the ideas are kept alive and honest through the immediacy of her practices—in psychotherapy, in somatics, and in spirituality. I hope that this book is read widely both in and beyond the IFS community.”
—Susan Aposhyan, LPC, author of Body-Mind Psychotherapy

“A brilliant psychotherapeutic integration of mind and body by a wise and experienced somatic practitioner.… Through descriptions and explanations of the five practices of Somatic IFS, illustrative case examples, and guided practices, the author connects the gifts of ancient medicine and contemporary neuroscience to the benefit of professionals and laypersons alike. A unique and timely book.”

Peter A. Levine Ph.D.,"Extrait
From Chapter 3: Wounds That Can Heal

When a young tree is injured it grows around that injury. As the tree continues to develop, the wound becomes relatively small in proportion to the size of the tree. Gnarly burls and misshapen limbs speak of injuries and obstacles encountered through time and overcome. The way a tree grows around its past contributes to its exquisite individuality, character, and beauty. I certainly don’t advocate traumatization to build character, but since trauma is almost a given at some point in our lives, the image of the tree can be a valuable mirror.

Although human beings have been experiencing trauma for thousands of years, it is only in the last ten years that it has begun to receive widespread professional and public attention...

Quatrième de couverture
How to pass on strength not pain to those you love.

When a physical wound is left unhealed, it continues to cause pain and can infect the whole body. When emotions are left unhealed, they similarly cause harm that spreads to other parts of our lives, hurting our family, friends and colleagues. Eventually, this hurt spreads further, affecting entire communities and families across generations.

This is intergenerational trauma. It can lead us to become people-pleasers, co-dependent in relationships and even estranged from our families. The wounds are complex and continue to invade our minds, bodies and spirits long after.

In Break the Cycle, Dr Mariel Buqué delivers the ground-breaking guide to healing inherited trauma. Weaving scientific research with practical exercises and stories from her therapy room, Dr Buqué will help you understand how trauma is inherited from one generation to the next, break the cycle and disrupt the flow of intergenerational trauma with therapeutic exercises, and encourage you to pass on strength - not pain - to future generations.

With a holistic approach to healing that has been absent from the field of psychology for too long, Break the Cycle will help you shift intergenerational trauma to intergenerational abundance.

Chapter 1

What Is Self-­Loss?

Here’s a visualization I often do with my clients to give them a sense of what self-­loss feels like:

Imagine you’re alone, sitting in a worn, leather armchair in the middle of a room. In front of you is a chipped coffee table straining to support the weight of the numerous dusty books that you intended to read but never found time for. You have a cup of coffee that has grown cold, the milk curdled on the surface. On the side table next to you is a vintage green lamp, merely ornamental ever since the room has been set ablaze.

The flames are creeping up the walls, peeling the wallpaper and sending parachutes of ash in midair. The flares slowly inch toward you; little sparks burning holes in the rug at your feet. You can barely see through the smog; your lungs fill with smoke, your eyes water. Yet you continue to sit there—­paying bills, checking your email, making work deadlines, sending long, upset text messages, or posting inspirational quotes on Instagram—­ignoring your impending death. You hear faint instinctual inner screams. A voice deep inside is urging you to MOVE.

But instead, you convince yourself that “this is fine”; that you are fine, in control, even. That the way you have chosen to live will not hurt you. Your life is threatened, but for some reason or another you don’t see it; you ignore it, or perhaps you’re waiting for someone else to save you. You are too “busy” to save yourself. Or, maybe you notice the flames, but you are preoccupied with debating who set the fire in the first place—­you’d rather figure out who to blame than find a way to live. Regardless of the specifics, you don’t choose to extinguish the fire, which ultimately means you are choosing to get burned.

I ask my clients to sit with, explore, and make meaning of this metaphor. When they have constructed their own interpretation, I share my intent:

We are alone in the room because that’s a given—­no one will ever truly know what it’s like to be us. The old, worn armchair represents the comfort we feel from the habits and patterns we’ve developed. It’s placed in the center of the room because we are often—­for better or for worse—­the focal point of our own lives. Our strained relationships (the table) are burdened by our lack of self-­growth and healing (the unopened books). The cold coffee represents time passing, and complacency settling in. The lamp represents our dimming awareness, its light overpowered by the flames (our denial) creeping up the walls.

The wallpaper represents our boundaries. Over time, it begins to peel off and compromise the integrity of the room, of who we are. The rug, our foundation—­beliefs, morals, values—­is set ablaze and we struggle to find our footing. The blurred vision is the detrimental stories we tell ourselves, and the smog filling our lungs is all the things we consume that we believe will make us “whole,” but don’t. We successfully ignore signs of danger and the call to responsibility. We surrender our freedom and risk our lives to enjoy the warmth of the familiar—­our so-­called obligations and day-­to-­day mundanities. We may not know why we find ourselves in a burning room or who is to blame, but ultimately the only thing that matters is what we do about it.

It can be hard to wrap our heads around the idea of facing such a clear threat and continuing to live as if it’s of no consequence. It’s difficult to imagine that someone on the verge of losing something as significant as their Self can ignore the warning signs. This loss—­this impending danger that I am talking about—­is not physical, it is existential.

And it’s the danger that most of us face as a consequence of the way we choose to live our everyday lives.

Let’s spend a day in the life of a girl named Alex. When her alarm goes off in the morning, the first thing she does is grab her phone. It will only take a couple of seconds before her finger taps on the first app. As her eyes adjust to the brightness, she will squint away the blur of her screen and check her DMs, silently calculating when to respond or like a picture without looking too eager. She will mindlessly scroll for a couple of minutes, or ten, or twenty-­five, consciously or subconsciously taking note of other people’s lives, body shapes, or success, adding new insecurities, comparisons, or expectations to the back of her mind. Eventually she will hurry around her apartment to get ready (for the gaze of others), and if there is enough time to do one thing for herself that morning—­it’s going to be coffee. Always. Alex will chug it as she hops on her first online meeting or rushes out the door to catch the train, completely forgetting to eat breakfast, drink water . . . or take a deep breath.

At work, she puts on a faint smile while dealing with people who are unpleasant, unkind, or just bad at their jobs. She lives by her online calendar, which tells her who to talk to and when, and which tasks she needs to tackle. She often checks her emails during long calls, paying very little attention to either. If she is feeling annoyed, she’ll send a snarky text to a colleague on the same video call—­waiting to see if they crack a smile. At lunch, she will get a caffeine refill and eat some food, while barely taking a moment to notice its taste. She will take a picture of her outfit or the view from her desk—­commenting on the weather, her workload, or making a self-­deprecating joke. Every two or three minutes, Alex will check to see who’s viewed her story and look at it herself—­her pictures tend to paint her life better than she knows how to live it, and looking at them helps her feel like she’s living much more than she actually is.

After work, she might hop on her Peloton, not because she cares about her health but because she hates her body. Afterward, she will meet up with her friends or watch Netflix on the couch in an effort to distract herself from feeling drained, upset, bored, or unfulfilled, while spending the majority of the time glancing at her phone, wondering if that person she’s seeing is going to text her back. Eventually she crawls into bed and looks at her screen until her eyelids get heavy.

Alex has become accustomed to (some might even say comfortable with) living in the burning room.

And with every passing day, she sinks deeper into self-­loss.

Does any of this feel familiar?

The term “self-­loss” almost sounds like we can misplace our essence like a set of car keys or our phone charger. And although arguably a tempting explanation, it would be inaccurate to compare self-­loss to losing something or someone else. Simply put: Self-­loss is being estranged from and lacking congruence, resonance, and alliance with who we truly are. It’s the feeling of being inconsistent and inauthentic—­of having our actions, feelings, and decisions cease to represent how we understand and experience ourselves as “truly” being.

The regrettable reality is that too many of us go on with life unfazed by the fact that we do not know who we are. As an existential therapist, I have come to understand that the human sense of Self is the staple of well-­being, relationships, and fulfillment. Self-­loss, on the other hand, is often why we fail to communicate and set boundaries, why we hold on to beliefs that no longer serve us, why we struggle in relationships, why we are overwhelmed or scared to make decisions, why self-­love is so goddamn difficult, and finally, why so many of us fail to find meaning and purpose in our lives.

If you are reading this, chances are you spend much of your time feeling like the walking dead, not fully conscious, vibrant, or free. This state of existence is so common that, at this point, I would be as bold as to say that self-­loss has become part of the human condition. It is not pathological, it is not a diagnosis (although it can be comorbid with other mental health struggles). It is something many of us face and it is the obstacle that stands in the way of authenticity, fulfillment, and meaningful connection with others.

The crux of self-­loss is that it doesn’t allow us to exist—­not truly. Not in a way we find fulfilling or, perhaps, even worth all the effort.

CHAPTER 1

RUNNING ON AUTOMATIC

Why would a beautiful, intelligent woman keep picking the wrong men, and then when they try to break up with her, throw herself on the floor clutching their legs, begging them not to leave?

Ben is a successful businessman. Why is he hit with anxiety whenever he has to make a presentation?

Stacey has been trying one therapist after another for years to discover why she has an almost constant feeling of dread, fears of abandonment and an eating disorder. Strangest of all, she has repeated images of the color red and a candle. It makes no sense to her, but it has been going on for as long as she can remember.

Interestingly, there is a simple explanation for their problems that involves how the brain itself functions. In this book, we will explore both the reasons for suffering and what we can do about it.

WHY WE SUFFER

The truth is we all suffer at one time or another. Situations arise all the time that affect us negatively. But when we continue to have pain long after the experience itself has passed, it is because the hardwiring of our brains influences our minds. Let&#39s try the following experiment so you can see for yourself. I&#39ll give a single sentence and you just notice the first thing that pops into your mind:

Roses are red

The odds are that the first thing to come up was: Violets are blue. For people born in the United States, it&#39s basically the equivalent of a knee- jerk response. This is an important concept, since mental responses are based on physical reactions. Your brain is programmed to respond in the same way as the rest of your body. Regardless of age or gender, when your knee is hit in a certain way your leg will jerk. Similarly, regardless of intention, your mind also reacts automatically. For instance, when is the last time you heard that rhyme? You probably learned it in childhood. So, if you don&#39t live with young children, it was likely many, many years ago. But it came up automatically nonetheless. These types of automatic responses can be wonderful and useful, and show the power of our minds, but they don&#39t always serve us.

Take a look at the sentences themselves. Your response to ""Roses are red"" wasn&#39t a critical evaluation of its meaning. Your mind just moved along with a response as if it was true. But roses aren&#39t always red. They are also yellow, pink, purple and most any color you can think of. However, that unexamined sentence looks just fine at first glance. And how about the second one: Violets are blue. Are they really? No, actually they are purple. But the line will come up whether it&#39s true or not. Now, probably the sentence didn&#39t cause you any kind of distress. But that same type of automatic response also causes a wide range of problems that disrupt happiness, families and communities. The same mind/brain processes that allow us to recognize a rhyme, or sing along with a tune we haven&#39t heard in 20 years, are the ones that can also drown us in the misery of anxiety, depression, heartache and at times physical pain.

The nursery rhyme has even more to offer. Remember the line that comes after ""Violets are blue""? ""Sugar is sweet and so are you."" Lovely sentiment, and it also comes to mind automatically. But as we all know, while sugar is surely sweet, people are lots more complicated. Everyone is a mixture of sweet, sour and every flavor and variation under the sun. At some point, everyone is angry, sad, jealous, bitter, hurt, insecure, happy or sweet. And when we are, we act accordingly. One moment we cherish the one we are with and cover them with kisses. A day later we may explode and yell at them in frustration. So, basically, some of what we&#39ve learned growing up is true, but just as with all the other experiences we&#39ve had through childhood, other things are not. Often as youngsters we can&#39t tell the difference, and what we take to be real--such as believing we are inferior because we are bullied or rejected, or thinking we are responsible for our parents&#39 divorce--are really just misperceptions. Nevertheless, these experiences can have effects that come up automatically throughout the rest of our lives, outside our conscious control.

Every experience we&#39ve had in our lives has become a building block in our inner world, governing our reactions to everything and every person we encounter. When we ""learn"" something, the experience is physically stored within networks of brain cells called ""neurons."" These networks actually form our unconscious mind, determining how our brain interprets the world around us and governing how we feel from moment to moment. These memories include experiences that took place years ago, and our conscious mind is often unaware that they have any impact on us at all. But since the memories are physically stored in the brain, they can pop up outside our control in response to ""Roses are red,"" just as they color our view of every new situation we encounter. They can cause us to feel unattractive when we&#39re not. Depressed when everyone else around us is happy. And they can leave us feeling heartsick if someone leaves us--even if we know consciously that the person is terrible for us and continuing the relationship would be a big mistake. Basically, many of the feelings and actions that undermine our happiness are symptoms that stem from this memory system that forms the unconscious.

Let&#39s take the first case from page 1:

Why would a beautiful, intelligent woman keep picking the wrong men, and then when they try to break up with her, throw herself on the floor clutching their legs, begging them not to leave?

Justine has no problems getting boyfriends. Her problem is keeping them. Now 25 years old, she generally picks men with an ""edge"" who are emotionally unavailable. Then every time she gets into a relationship, she begins acting clingy and her boyfriend eventually breaks up with her. When this happens, she begins to cry hysterically, falling to her knees and putting her arms around the man&#39s legs, pleading with him not to leave her. In therapy, the cause of this was tracked back to something that happened on a Sunday evening when she was 6 years old. Justine was living with her parents in a two-story house. On that night there was a severe thunderstorm, causing her to become very frightened. Upstairs in her bedroom, she began crying and yelling for her mommy and daddy to come to her. However, they were in the kitchen on the first floor. The storm drowned out her screams, and they didn&#39t hear her. They never came to her rescue and she eventually cried herself to sleep.

How could something as common as this be responsible for her problems? All of us have experienced loud storms sometime in childhood, but only some of us will remain negatively affected by it. We&#39ll go into the detailed reasons for this in later chapters. For now, it&#39s sufficient to know that when negative reactions and behaviors in the present can be tracked directly back to an earlier memory, we define those memories as ""unprocessed""--meaning that they are stored in the brain in a way that still holds the emotions, physical sensations and beliefs that were experienced earlier in life. That stormy night Justine was intensely frightened as a child, and had the belief that she was in danger. Her parents didn&#39t come when she cried for them, which also gave her the feeling that she would be abandoned if she really needed them. This memory, stored in her brain with the intense fear she experienced at 6 years old, is stimulated whenever a boyfriend breaks up with her. At this point, she no longer functions as a mature and successful 25-yearold, but instead as a frightened little girl left alone in the dark. We can see the connection, given that the storm and a breakup are both associated with aloneness and abandonment. As such, she unconsciously experiences the breakup as ""being in danger.""

We experience these types of connections all the time. It&#39s generally the reason for all of the characteristics we love or hate in ourselves and the people around us. It&#39s simply part of the way the brain functions in order to make sense of the world. But identifying the memory connections is just the first step in changing how we think, act or feel. It&#39s not just understanding where something comes from, but also knowing what to do about it that&#39s important. In the course of this book we will be exploring how to identify the memories that underlie personal and relationship problems; what we can do to help manage them on our own; and how to recognize when further professional help would be useful.

We&#39ll also explore the workings of the mind--the intricate connections that form our consciousness--through stories contributed by some of the more than 70,000 clinicians worldwide who practice a form of therapy known as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Millions of people have been helped by the therapy over the past 20 years, and many of them are giving detailed reports in this book in order to help ""demystify"" the change process. As research has shown, major changes can take place within even one EMDR reprocessing session. The clients&#39 reports allow us a ""window into the brain,"" since the connections they made answer so many questions about why we react to the world in different ways.

EMDR therapy targets the unprocessed memories that contain the negative emotions, sensations and beliefs. By activating the brain&#39s information processing system (which will be explained in Chapter 2), the old memories can then be ""digested."" Meaning what is useful is learned, what&#39s useless is discarded, and the memory is now stored in a way that is no longer damaging. For instance, Justine&#39s clinician focused on the thunderstorm along with the feeling she had of being alone and in danger. Once the memory of the thunderstorm was processed, the childhood sensations of terror disappeared and were replaced by the feeling of safety, and the belief that as an adult she could take care of herself. Along with that, the boyfriend problem resolved as her new sense of self resulted in her making different romantic choices. Of course there would be more memories that might have to be dealt with if Justine&#39s parents had been generally abusive or neglectful. But regardless of the number of memories involved, basically we are entering into the person&#39s ""unconscious"" mind with this form of therapy, in a way that can allow insights, connections and change to occur rapidly within the reprocessing sessions.

WHAT IS THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND?

When most people think of the unconscious, they think of psychoanalysis and movies that involve a Freudian view of psychic conflicts, and symbolic dreams and gestures. From the psychoanalytic perspective it generally takes years of talk therapy and ""working through"" to gain insight and mastery over forces that are hidden from view. This form of therapy can have great value. But Freud published first in 1900, and many things have changed since then. In the past century there have been new advances in neurobiological technologies that have expanded our understanding of what these ""forces"" actually are. The examination of the unconscious we are dealing with in this book is one that is based on the workings of the brain itself. Through an understanding of how experiences lay the physical groundwork for our emotional and physical reactions, we can determine how our ""stuck"" points and knee-jerk mental responses came about and what to do about them.

For instance, let&#39s take the second case:

Ben is a successful businessman. Why is he hit with anxiety whenever he has to make a presentation? Here&#39s how he described it:

""As long as I can remember, I&#39ve had anxiety about doing any performance in front of a group of people. My palms sweat, my voice becomes unpredictable, my heart beats fast and I have thoughts like, &#39I&#39m an idiot. I can&#39t do this. Everyone will hate me.&#39 It sometimes felt as though my life was at risk. Sounds ridiculous, but it was so true. As I went through school, there were many times in the normal course of events when I had to make public presentations. In my professional career the same thing happened. I always made it through these events, but not happily. In fact, I suffered before and after every event, and tediously went over every detail with my loved ones, which, as you might imagine, did not delight them. No matter what I tried, nothing seemed to fix this problem. I tried many types of therapy. Sometimes it seemed a little better, but it always came roaring back.""

Ben entered into EMDR therapy and used a variety of procedures that we&#39ll learn in this book to identify the source of his problem and change his reactions. Here&#39s what he discovered: ""It turns out the cause was something that happened to me when I was no more than 3 1/2 years old. I was walking with my grandfather on his farm in western North Carolina. My memory here is as if I was looking up, like a very small child. I don&#39t remember chattering away to my grandfather, but if family stories can be trusted, I probably was. We met a strange man on the road. He was old, bent, angry looking, with very hairy nostrils. He said to my grandfather in his mountain drawl, &#39Well, howdy, if I had a youngun&#39 talked as much as that un, I&#39d drown him in the creek.&#39 I slipped behind my grandfather&#39s denim-covered leg, peered up the man&#39s nostrils and shut up. I knew that unwanted kittens were in fact &#39drowned in the creek.&#39 It did not seem safe to chatter in front of strangers.""
