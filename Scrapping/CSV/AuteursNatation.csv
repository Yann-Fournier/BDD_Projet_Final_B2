Susie Parr,"A fascinating social history. An essential read for every wild swimmer. --Kate Rew, author of &#39Wild Swim&#39 and founder of The Outdoor Swimming Society.

An intriguing investigation of water&#39s influence on the psyche and society. - --Daniel Start, author of &#39Wild Swimming&#39 and &#39Wild Swimming Coast&#39.

In this magnificent book about outdoor swimming part cultural history, part journal Susie Parr recognises the way water changes and stays the same, exerting its power and pull through time. This is a chronological story and a personal exploration of an &#39addiction&#39 to swimming. The book is the size of a large stepping-stone, with a picture of a demure, naked, 18th-century swimmer (Thomas Rowlandson&#39s Venus) attempting an improbably decorous stroke on its pale blue cover. The glorious illustrations stop one in one&#39s tracks: there is a comically urgent photograph of helicopter pilots bustling into a bitter Shetland sea on Boxing Day (re-enacting an ancient cleansing ritual). There is a spooky mermaid scarecrow, wrapped in a green fishing net a strange catch smiling through eyes like black beetles, her chest studded in shells. There are Donald McGill&#39s saucy seaside postcards (once graded &#39mild&#39, &#39medium&#39 and &#39strong&#39) and there are bathing belles galore it is touching to look back through the years at their holiday faces. And there is a wonderful photograph of Susie Parr on Raasay beach, arms wide open, about to step into the water. This and many of the book&#39s most striking pictures are by her husband, Martin Parr first-rate photographer and confirmed landlubber. But the book should come with a warning: do not let its illustrations keep you from the fascinating, meticulously researched, beautifully written text. This history fresh and salty connects one to every swimmer who ever swam. It also makes one glad to be a swimmer now. Swimmers of yesteryear swam heavy: Roman soldiers sometimes swam in armour. An Elizabethan gentleman strolled into the water with a knife to pare his toenails and a hawk showily balanced on his wrist. Victorian women wore hats, coats, shoes and corsets into the briny. How wonderful that nowadays we don&#39t need much more than determination and a towel. A particularly absorbing chapter is devoted to the romantic poets who saw swimming as an encounter with the sublime. Parr&#39s dripping dramatis personae includes Shelley (who could not, to his chagrin, swim and eventually drowned). But he was a persistent bather and once caused a stir pitching up at a dinner party naked, malodorous and with seaweed in his hair. Parr is entertaining, too, about &#39Lord Byron, Noted swimmer and poet&#39 (as he is remembered on a plinth in the Bay of La Spezia). As well as swimming the Hellespont, he would jump into Venetian canals to avoid &#39compromising&#39 situations. And, one suddenly realises, Byron&#39s was a swimmer&#39s poetry: fluent, rhythmical, long haul. For Swinburne, the affair was with the sea itself. Its slap and tickle was translated into luxuriously masochistic verse that was promptly banned. It is pleasing, too, to discover that Jane Austen who mocked romanticism loved bathing (I like to imagine a dainty breaststroke). Today&#39s &#39wild swimming&#39 is indebted to romanticism. And Parr interviews a variety of inspiring cold core swimmers (she suggests, unconvincingly, that her own swimming is more tame than wild). They believe, as swimmers have for centuries, that cold water is good for the health and a time-honoured cure for depression. And she explains &#39anticipatory thermogenesis&#39, the mind-over-water ability to boost one&#39s body&#39s core temperature before an icy plunge. For anyone not tempted to try out anticipatory thermogenesis this December, there can be no lovelier way in which to swim vicariously than through this book. I plan to dip in reregularly until spring. --Kate Kellaway, The Observer, Sunday 4 December 2011",

Excerpted from Chapter 1

Beginnings

Allure of the Open Water

Oceans, lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams are some of the most beautiful places on earth to swim. Nothing compares with breaking free from the confines of a swimming pool and swimming in salty or sweet waters, as far as your arms will carry you. You are immediately lifted by the water, bounced by the waves, and massaged by the movement of your body through the water.

You feel sunshine warming your back, see shafts of sunlight illuminate the water below, hear the song of the wind and the waves, and as you swim, you hear the rhythms of your hands and feet as they catch and move water. You hear the music of your body and your breath as the wind, current, swell, and tide change, and the sounds of your body changing with it. You are immersed in this water song, and each day it is different.

Each day is a great adventure. You never know what you will experience until you get in and swim.

For forty years I have swum in the open water. At age fourteen I swam across the Catalina Channel and, at age fifteen, broke the men’s and women’s world records for the English Channel. Since then, I’ve completed sixty challenging open water swims—some were world-record swims, others were firsts, and all offered unique, exciting, and interesting challenges.

The sport of open water swimming is exploding like jogging did in the 1970s in the United States and Britain. There are more than nine hundred competitive open water swims across the United States throughout the year. There is a booming business in swim travel, in which swimmers travel to beautiful and exotic places like Greece, Turkey, and the Caribbean and participate in open water camps and swim along shore, between islands, and across straits.

The reason for this phenomenal growth in the sport may be because triathlon and open water swimming have gained Olympic status, since 2000 and 2008, respectively. According to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA), an estimated 2.3 million people completed a triathlon in 2010, an increase of 55 percent from the year before, and the New York Triathlon sold out in eleven minutes despite an entry fee just shy of nine hundred dollars (see Sources for more information; page 299).

Thomas Johnson, former president and current open water swim director of the Triathlon Club of San Diego (see Sources for website address; page 299), has watched this amazing growth and was involved with organizing the 2012 ITU World Triathlon San Diego, which served as the second qualifier for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Triathlon team. He predicted that the sport would expand even more after the Olympic qualifying event and Olympic Games.

John Martin, the communications and media relations manager at USA Triathlon, said there were 122,388 USA Triathlon members in 2000 and by 2012 there were 636,335 members. Martin said:

There are many reasons such as: society’s interest in fitness and living a healthy lifestyle, the growth of the number of total races across the country, making events easier to get to, the growth in the number of the more accessible shorter sprint distance races, which made the sport more accessible to those with fewer hours to train each week, growth in the 30–49 age groups who are looking for varied outlets for fitness, an increase in the number of USA Triathlon clubs, which fosters a community concept for men and especially women who enjoy the group training and support atmosphere, an increase in resources (websites, books, magazines) that provide assistance/education in getting started, growth in multisport shops and triathlon specific training and racing gear, marketing and communications efforts of USA Triathlon, the growth in the number of USA Triathlon certified coaches who are able to provide training plans and individual attention for athletes who need guidance and motivation, and USA Triathlon–sanctioned 4,300 multisport events in 2011.

This enormous expansion of triathlon has had a huge impact on the growth of open water because swimming is one of the races included in the triathlon. There has been a dramatic increase in media visibility and interest in both triathlon and open water swimming. Young swimmers are also participating in the sport, especially those who have been involved in junior lifeguard programs. Some university and college swimming coaches are incorporating open water swims during long-distance winter training sessions, to give the athletes a break from swimming thousands of mind-numbing meters in the pool. The swimmers are enjoying the challenge of swimming in the wild blue waters. Young and older swimmers who have spent years of their lives swimming back and forth in pools are reading books and magazines about open water swimming and triathlons and are inspired to swim in untamed water. They want to train, set open water swimming goals, and discover ways to make the extreme environment of the open water accessible for themselves.

Last year there were record numbers of people swimming the English Channel (between England and Europe) and the Catalina Channel (between Catalina Island and the mainland of California). The sport has become so popular that British television now broadcasts open water swims during prime time.

What most athletes don’t realize is that open water swimming is a high-risk sport. This lack of awareness became very apparent to me on three separate occasions. The first occurred when a swimming friend in Laguna Beach, California, invited me to join him for an early dip. The fog was rolling in rapidly, reducing visibility to three hundred yards. We decided to swim only one hundred yards out to a buoy and then back in, because the fog was growing thicker, and we knew there was a chance of getting lost, even close to shore.

We met four triathletes, two men who had trained in the area a few times and two women who had never swum off that beach. They were planning to swim out to the buoy, parallel the shore, and swim toward cliffs about a half mile and back. One of the women asked if I would join them, and I said I didn’t think it was safe.

They were wearing wet suits and dark caps, and they set off into a rolling wall of fog that quickly erased the sounds of their strokes and consumed them. Had they considered what would happen to them if the fog suddenly grew thicker; what they would do if they became separated or disoriented? Did they know how to find their way back to shore? Did they realize that they were completely invisible in the fog? Did they realize boaters and Jet Skiers wouldn’t be able to see them and could easily run over them? They were oblivious to the risk they had taken or their responsibility to ensure the safety of their group. They were lucky they made it back without a problem.

A few weeks later, a friend who was just learning how to swim in the ocean was swimming parallel to shore outside the surf line. He had completed his workout and was turning in to the beach to swim to shore.

He forgot that he needed to look back to check the surf conditions. He was completely unaware that the dark blue long bump in the ocean was a wave growing behind him. He did not realize that this wave was a shore break. He suddenly felt the wave rapidly lifting him higher and higher and higher, tipping him forward and launching him into the air. He felt himself falling and the water rushing around him and suddenly pounding him into the beach.

He closed his eyes and felt himself flipping over the falls as tons of water crashed onto his body. He spun around and tried to find air, but the white water filled with sand was holding him under. His head finally broke the surface for a moment, and he gasped for a breath and tried to get his feet under him, but another wave, just as large, crashed on him and bounced him like a basketball on the beach.

He was submerged for what seemed like forever, but at last he planted his feet, stood up, and stumbled toward shore. The rip created by the backwash dragged him backward into the path of the approaching wave.

For the first time, he glanced over his shoulder and saw the next wave cresting. He leaned forward and, using his core strength, fought the backwash, pushed hard into the sand with feet, and staggered out of the water, coughing, his goggles twisted on his head, sand streaming down his face, shoulders, chest, sides, and filling his swimsuit. He looked up at his friends who had run down the beach to help him. He waved and smiled sheepishly and said he was okay. He understood that he could have been severely hurt in the shore break.

Shortly after that, I watched another swimmer, in his midforties, swimming off Seal Beach, California. He was breathing only on the right side of his body, so he was completely blind on the left. Because of this breathing pattern, he pulled stronger with his right arm than with his left. He had no spatial awareness, no sense of ocean navigation, and he could not see that he was swimming right into an area of heavy boating traffic. He had no idea that he was putting himself in danger. He was okay once he reached shore.

It was because of these events and many others that I realized there needed to be a book for all levels of open water swimmers, including those of us who have been swimming in the open water for years but still have so much to learn.

Scientists, physicians, lifeguards, and other experts offered to provide key information to help swimmers become more aware of the open water environment and to know how to handle themselves in the water.

Expert Sources and Credentials

Even though I’d completed swims in remote parts of the world and I’d worked with various navies and coast guards to achieve my goals, I knew that there was so much more to know about seamanship, risk management, and other topics connected to open water swimming.

A friend in the United States Air Force offered to put me in touch with the U.S. Navy SEALs. The SEALs are members of the United States Naval Special Warfare unit, or NSW, who are trained for unconventional warfare; “SEAL” is an acronym for “sea, air, and land.” NSW is the agency that provides units to conduct maritime special operations, since the SEALs are America’s elite maritime force. They know more about operational risk management than anyone; they are the experts in assessing, reducing, and mitigating risks. They have established protocols that they abide by to ensure safety. They are experts in seamanship, can work in teams, and know how to survive in the wildest ocean conditions.

The SEALs welcomed me to their base in Coronado, California, to observe their sessions with the trainees, instructors, and officers, to see the best in the world train, to understand the way the elite force implements safety measures, and to observe how everything is done in a completely professional way.

I was allowed to sit in during the instructors’ discussions about the trainees, which enabled me to understand the amount of planning, discussion, and attention to detail that goes into each training evolution, or session. They discussed everything in precise detail: how to initiate drills and exercises, how long each one will last, how to ensure the trainees’ safety, how often the trainees hydrate, how frequently the metal scuba tanks sitting in the hot sun are cooled to prevent the trainees from being burned. They reviewed how they would inspect each trainee, what errors to check for, and the number of push-ups trainees would do if they made a mistake. They also let me see the high-risk documentation that ensured the trainees’ safety. Equally important, the SEALs let me see the level of qualification required by every instructor who supervises a training event, whether it’s something as simple as a run or as complex as a dive.

The senior SEAL who contributed so much invaluable information, anecdotal stories, and guidance cannot be named because he is on active duty, so I will refer to him as L. Tadeus. His credentials are tremendously impressive. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy, earned his commission as an officer, and spent fourteen years working in the U.S. Navy SEAL teams—eight years operational and six years in a high-risk training capacity, supervising almost every type of high-risk maritime training conducted by Special Operations Forces (SOF). He has spent three years specifically conducting physical training events, from 2-mile to 5.5-mile (3.2-kilometer to 8.8-kilometer) swims and 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) runs. He is a Combatant Dive Training subject matter expert; Command Diving Officer and Diving Supervisor; Submersible Pilot/Navigator; and Military Small Craft Operator. The SEAL is trained in all levels of Operational Risk Management, is a Military Master Training Specialist (MTS) 9502 NEC, and has earned numerous civilian maritime certifications, up to and including two-hundred-ton boats, and is a certified Captain Near Coastal (International Yacht Training [IYT]).

Among L. Tadeus’s many training credentials is an additional qualification that made a huge difference to this manual. Like other senior SEALs, he has analyzed and investigated accidents that occurred during training. When he was not the actual Investigating Officer, he closely followed safety mishap investigations in cooperation with his Command Safety Manager to ensure that appropriate lessons were learned, and he institutionalized those lessons within the training curriculum so that no one would have to relearn them the hard way. He offered me many helpful illustrations of dangerous swim-training scenarios. He provided recommendations for finding support boats and people, equipment, and methods for incorporating risk management into open water swimming. He also gave me pearls of wisdom that he earned and learned through challenging experiences as a SEAL, an instructor, and a leader. He shared his knowledge generously to help open water swimmers swim safely and to help them achieve their worthy goals.

Rick Knepper also provided invaluable information. Rick is a sixty-three-year-old retired Navy SEAL Master Chief who has spent the past forty-five years with the Naval Special Warfare community, both for active duty and civil service. He has approximately thirty years working within the SEAL schoolhouse, with extensive time training SEAL candidates in all fundamental aquatic skills and surface swimming for ocean swims up to five and a half nautical miles. Additionally, he has been an aquatics trainer for numerous instructors’ staffs over the years and continues to fulfill this need when required. He has revised and designed various aquatic programs with the SEAL training pipeline and has served as an aquatics consultant with other navy organizations. For the past twenty-five years, Rick has been swimming open water marathons. At the age of fifty, he completed the Catalina Channel crossing and a local twenty-four-mile sanctioned solo swim off San Diego. He is currently training for a thirty-six-mile (57.9-kilometer) swim scheduled in 2013 off Coronado Island.
Revue de presse
Praise for Lynne Cox&#39s Open Water Swimming Manual

""A paean to outdoor immersion. . . . [Cox] has channeled her vast expertise on the dangers, joys and logistics of open water swimming into a new book aimed at the exploding ranks of triathletes and other swimmers who are escaping the safe confines of pools. . . . The publication could hardly be better timed. A steep rise in the popularity of triathlons has been swelling the ranks of open water events. . . . [Cox] tempers vision and enthusiasm with methodical, unstinting effort.""
—Andrea Kannapell, The New York Times

""Lynne Cox’s books are the works of a singular mind. That was true for the best sellers Swimming to Antarctica and Grayson, and it is true for her new book, Open Water Swimming Manual, a 300-page paperback instructional that is the most unlikely page-turner you could put on your summer reading list. She’s written a sort of fantasy in which you, the reader, are the protagonist. You can’t swim half a mile? Cox will put you on a program to swim 10! . . . Cox’s Open Water Swimming Manual could do for long-distance swimming what Jim Fixx’s The Complete Book of Running did for the American jogging movement in 1977.""
—Sports Illustrated

""Lynne Cox is an artist of the open water. No one knows more about swimming&#39s beauty and skill than this great champion, or could describe it with such clarity and grace. Every sport—every art—should have a book like this and a guide like Lynne Cox.""
—Christopher McDougall, author of Born to Run

There seems to be nothing she cannot write or paint about: adolescence, Canada, yearning, dawn - even cake, for heaven&#39s sake! - with a precision both surgical and poetic.  The joys of Swimming Studies are in being in the care of someone of a prodigious and protean mind.  My talent crush is official and deep.”
—David Rakoff, author of Half Empty

“I&#39m so happy this book exists.  Swimming Studies expresses what it&#39s like to be haunted by the person one used to be, and the search for how that person exists in the present.  Leanne Shapton writes with such curiosity, ruefulness, intelligence, and grace.  Here we see how the discipline of being an athlete can condition one&#39s way of making art, and how the patience necessary to make art teaches other types of patience.  Like the patience required to be a spouse and to love a person always.  This book is a rare treat for anyone who cares about any of these things.”
—Sheila Heti, author of How Should a Person Be?

“A fusion of cool, clear-eyed prose and watercolors, photographs and painted portraits...[and] a curiously arresting study of the transition from a world of rigor and routine to one of reflection and recreation....The brilliance of Swimming Studies lies in its delicate exploration of how the identities we’ve carved out for ourselves in the present are both haunted and shaped by the people we used to be.”
—Time Out New York

“[W]hat makes this book astounding....[is] any dedicated swimmer knows exactly what Shapton means; we sense and control our movements, from the tips of our fingers to the flutter of our feet, breathing very specifically, detecting any shifts in conditions, from the presence of other swimmers to the tug of a current....Shapton pares down her experiences as a swimmer and grafts the core lessons to other parts of her life, allowing them to bloom in ways that have everything and nothing to do with swimming.”
—Buzz Poole, TheMillions.com

“A cool memoir about competitive swimming that might as well be called The Unbearable Lightness of Being....Shapton, never self-pitying, offers an original, mythical elixir of life in the water.”
—Newsweek

“[A] thoughtful, exquisitely written book...ostensibly about [Shapton’s] lifelong relationship to the sport, complete with photos of her various bathing suits and meditations on the difference between swimming (i.e., competitive swimming) and bathing (i.e., swimming for fun)....She even includes some haunting, cobalt blue illustrations of pools she frequents as an adult, as well as a color guide to different swimming smells, such as ""coach: fresh laundry, Windbreaker nylon, Mennen Speed Stick, Magic Marker, and bologna."" These extra visual elements dazzle, but the specifics of this world and her insightful take on her own far-from-ordinary life are what makes any reader wonder if Shapton&#39s gold medal might have already been won—in writing.”
—Oprah.com, Book of the Week

“Shapton draws on her experience training for the Olympic trials in a refreshing and thoughtful memoir about swimming as competition and way of life. Her ode to the water is not only philosophical but incredibly moving.”
—Entertainment Weekly

“The talented illustrator Leanne Shapton, in her pointillistic and quietly profound new memoir, Swimming Studies...writes as confidently as she draws, and memorably conjures swimming’s intense, primordial and isolating pleasures....Shapton’s prose frequently has the density of poetry....[she] is so smart and so likable that you will pass her book along to the swimmers in your life.”
—Dwight Garner, The New York Times

“In this small, lovely book, [Shapton] combines words and images in an exquisitely observed meditation on swimming and memory....What’s thrilling about this book is its author’s careful attention to detail and unlikely beauty. More impressionistic than a traditional memoir, the book nonetheless sketches an arc that brings the author back to competitive swimming, in masters races in the United States.”
—Kate Tuttle, The Boston Globe

“Painter and illustrator Leanne Shapton relates with poignancy the details of a competitive swimmer&#39s life...beautifully written, beautifully constructed, and thoughtful.”
—Huffington Post

“[Swimming Studies] is brilliant, eccentric and moving—an immersion in a life....Shapton has a novelist&#39s instinct for the nostalgic charge of the inconsequential....Her language is as crisp as the autumn day she describes.”
—Kate Kellaway, The Observer (UK)

“Acknowledging the ultimate incomprehensibility of athletic greatness, [Shapton] nonetheless brings us closer to its essence....If those countless practice laps and those not-quite-Olympian results were what it took to produce Swimming Studies, it was worth it: Shapton has bottled the elusive meaning of having tried and failed at a sport better than any book I’ve read since Pat Jordan’s classic A False Spring.  Read Swimming Studies and enjoy the incomprehensible greatness of the world’s best all the more.”
—Ian McGillis, The Montreal Gazette (Canada)

“[Shapton’s] eye for detail [is] amazingly shrewd...gaspingly beautiful in its insight, proving her project actually has very little to do with swimming...Swimming Studies is an intimate and beautiful meditation on human fallibility and the embarrassing, often unstated anxiety of success.”
—Stacey May Fowles, The National Post (Canada)

“In her illustrated memoir, Shapton, a writer, artist, and former contender for the Canadian Olympic team, grapples with the habits she learned as a teen-age competitive swimmer....and her honed attention to detail gives the reader the sensation of watching a meticulous mind watching itself, down to the hundredth of a second.”
—The New Yorker

“It looks like Shapton can succeed at whatever she puts her mind to; swimming is where that started....As few people can, Shapton draws a connection between making art and being an athlete, focusing on the unending effort it takes to do well....She is, no doubt, a creative powerhouse, one who puts words and pictures together with a quiet force that comes only from solid, dedicated practice.”
—Carolyn Kellogg, Los Angeles Times

“I was a competitive swimmer, and I have never read anything that captured the sport so well. Shapton knows just the details to include...Her sparse, satisfying prose is your guide, and you’re glad to get to swim beside her.”
—Carolyn Kormann, TheNewYorker.com

“Through immaculate observation and evocative recollection, Leanne Shapton’s autobiographical Swimming Studies achieves the seemingly impossible. In a series of sharp snapshots of life as a competitive swimmer and beyond, she has managed to find “the language of belonging,” giving a voice to silent hours spent submerged in water....beautifully written and gorgeous to look at, too....Ultimately, Swimming Studies is about more than swimming. It’s about how the discipline of competitive sport teaches routine, perseverance and good habits. It’s about how the diligence of athletic practice can translate into art, communication and even love.”

Francis Hodgson,"Splash! Dive into the cultural history of the artificial ocean. Featuring astonishing architecture and people, captured by the best photographers in the world.
As long as already five thousand years ago, the allure of the sea inspired humans to recreate its essence in miniature, artistic forms, as public baths where ancient rituals would take place. Since then, it has become quite normal to immerse ourselves in cooling waters, in the privacy of our homes and without religious incentives. Swimming pools have rapidly become status symbols and the source for many diverse experiences: leisure-time athletics, relaxation, or the simple pleasure of just being in water. It is no wonder then that filmmakers and photographers constantly return to the swimming pool as a subject and setting. Reflections of water and light are captured in countless, unique ways in the more than two hundred compelling images that comprise this catalogue. Also included of course are the images of those who animate it.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Charles Sprawson,"Paru en 1992 et devenu un livre culte, Héros et nageurs est le plus merveilleux ouvrage jamais écrit sur la nage, les plongeurs et le goût de l&#39eau. Entrelaçant tout à la fois l&#39histoire, la géographie - de la Grèce à la Polynésie -, la littérature, le cinéma, la peinture et bien sûr le sport, Charles Sprawson offre un récit enchanteur, ode à la culture classique autant que discrets Mémoires personnels, bourré d&#39érudition autant que de délicat humour anglais. Des Grecs et des Romains jusqu&#39aux Jeux olympiques modernes, des Anglais réinventant l&#39art de nager à l&#39ère victorienne aux fleuves des Indiens d&#39Amérique, du plongeon suédois à l&#39école de natation japonaise, il chemine dans le sillage des plus grands auteurs - et fervents nageurs - pour laisser entrevoir, dans l&#39immersion, une échappatoire vers le sublime et l&#39héroïque.",

Howard Means,"From the first recorded dip into what&#39s now the driest spot on earth to the recreational swimmers in your local pool, humans have been getting wet for 10,000 years. And for most of modern history, swimming has caused a ripple that touches us all.

Splash! dives into Egypt, winds through ancient Greece and Rome, flows mostly underground through the Dark and Middle Ages (at least in Europe), and then re-emerges in the wake of the Renaissance before taking its final lap at the modern Olympic Games. Along the way, it kicks away the idea that swimming is just about speed or great feats of aquatic endurance, revealing how its history spans religion, fashion, architecture, public health, colonialism, segregation, sexism, sexiness, guts, glory and much, much more.

As refreshing as jumping into a pool on a hot summer&#39s day, Splash! sweeps across the whole of humankind&#39s swimming history with an irrepressible enthusiasm that will make you crave your next dip.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png
