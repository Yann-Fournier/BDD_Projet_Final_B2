Natasha Campbell-McBride,"Amazon.fr
Le Dr Natasha Campbell-Mc Bride a fondé la clinique de nutrition de Cambridge (Cambridge Nutrition Clinic) en 1998. En tant que parent d&#39un enfant ayant souffert de sévères troubles de l&#39apprentissage, elle était particulièrement consciente des difficultés rencontrées par d&#39autres parents d&#39enfants en difficulté et a consacré le plus clair de son temps à aider ces familles. Elle s&#39est aperçue que la nutrition pouvait apporter une aide essentielle aux enfants et aux adultes luttant contre ces troubles ; elle a été la première à utiliser des probiotiques dans ce domaine.

Désireuse de partager ses connaissances, elle a publié de nombreux écrits et donné plusieurs séries de conférences et de séminaires ayant pour thème les troubles de l&#39apprentissage et les troubles digestifs. Cet ouvrage rend compte des connaissances qu&#39elle a acquises par l&#39expérience ainsi que de ses travaux les plus récents.

Le Dr Natasha Campbell-Mc Bride pense qu’il y a un lien tout à fait certain entre notre santé physique et mentale, entre notre façon de manger et l’état de notre système digestif ; les résultats de ses travaux ont confirmé ce point. Dans sa clinique, les parents abordent avec elle tous les aspects des troubles et des symptômes de leur enfant, mis en confiance par le fait qu’ils s’adressent non seulement à un médecin, mais aussi à une mère ayant vécu une expérience semblable à la leur. Son propre apprentissage sur le plan personnel rend d’autant plus précieux ses conseils et son accompagnement au combat quotidien que ces familles ont à mener.

Chris van Tulleken,"Revue de presse
You’ve got to get this book in your life . . . Completely compelling . . . Read a page and think about it for the rest of the week -- Chris Evans

A devastating, witty and scholarly destruction of the shit food we eat and why -- Adam Rutherford

If you only read one diet or nutrition book in your life, make it this one. It will not only change the way you eat but the way you think about food. And it does all this without a hint of finger-wagging or body shaming. I came away feeling so much better informed about every aspect of ultra-processed food, from the way it affects the microbes in our gut to why it is so profitable to produce to why it&#39s so hard to eat only a single bowl of Coco Pops to why any food that is marketed as &#39better for you&#39 is almost certainly not. -- Bee Wilson

A wonderful and fascinating exposé of ultra-processed food, edible substances with strange sounding ingredients which are manufactured by some of the wealthiest companies on the planet and which, worryingly, form an increasing part of our diet. As Chris shows, not only have these foods been formulated to ensure that we eat them constantly and without thought, but they hijack our ability to regulate what we eat, primarily by affecting our brains. And he backs up his claims with a powerful self-experiment, along with lots of rigorous and often shocking research. Reading this book will make you question what you eat and how it was produced -- Dr. Michael Mosley ― BBC presenter and bestselling author of The Fast Diet

Packed with ""I never knew that"" moments, Ultra-Processed People is a wonderfully playful book that changed forever how I think about what I eat and why -- Hannah Fry
Quatrième de couverture
Chosen by the SUNDAY TIMES, GUARDIAN, FT and DAILY MAIL as one of their BEST SUMMER BOOKS OF 2023

&#39If you only read one diet or nutrition book in your life, make it this one&#39 Bee Wilson

&#39A devastating, witty and scholarly destruction of the shit food we eat and why&#39 Adam Rutherford

---

An eye-opening investigation into the science, economics, history and production of ultra-processed food.

It&#39s not you, it&#39s the food.

We have entered a new &#39age of eating&#39 where most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food, food which is industrially processed and designed and marketed to be addictive. But do we really know what it&#39s doing to our bodies?

Join Chris in his travels through the world of food science and a UPF diet to discover what&#39s really going on. Find out why exercise and willpower can&#39t save us, and what UPF is really doing to our bodies, our health, our weight, and the planet (hint: nothing good).

For too long we&#39ve been told we just need to make different choices, when really we&#39re living in a food environment that makes it nigh-on impossible. So this is a book about our rights. The right to know what we eat and what it does to our bodies and the right to good, affordable food.

Health Food or Health Disaster?

The greatest obstacle to discovering the shape of the earth, the continents, and the ocean was not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.  —Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers, 1985

Actor Liam Hemsworth publicly blamed spinach smoothies for a 2019 kidney stone episode that required surgery. At age 29 he had to miss a movie premiere and an awards banquet because of it. In 2020, Men’s Health magazine quoted Mr. Hemsworth as saying: “February last year, I was feeling really low and lethargic and wasn’t feeling good generally. And then I got a kidney stone.” He added: “Every morning I was having five handfuls of spinach and then almond milk, almond butter, and also some vegan protein in a smoothie. And that was what I considered super healthy. So, I had to completely rethink what I was putting into my body.”

This book invites you to do just that: Rethink your “health” food.

Even moderate, relatively common levels of oxalate in a habitual diet can fuel the customary aches and pains of life: digestive distress, inflamed joints, chronic skin issues, brain fog or mood problems, as well as health declines associated with “normal” aging. And then there are those painful kidney stones. Eighty percent of them are formed from oxalate, much of which comes from the foods we eat.

Mr. Hemsworth was one of the lucky ones. Three weeks after completing a 10-day “green smoothie cleanse” for weight loss, a New York City woman with a history of gastric bypass surgery went to the Nassau University Medical Center on Long Island, complaining of persistent nausea, weakness, and poor appetite. She was immediately put on a low-oxalate diet, but it was too late, her kidneys did not recover, and she remained dialysis-dependent.

Similar examples of kidney failure due to consumption of “health foods” include a man, also attempting to lose weight, who juiced celery, carrots, parsley, beets with their greens, and spinach. The man’s kidneys were seriously damaged. His doctors at the Mayo Clinic prescribed dialysis and a low-oxalate diet. He stopped juicing. It took more than four months for his kidney function to improve.

And it’s not just kidney failure. Damage from dietary oxalate can hit any—or every—bodily system and cause serious chronic health problems. It’s no accident that Mr. Hemsworth’s kidney stones were preceded by malaise, depression, and lethargy. However, most medical journals reporting health crises from overzealous oxalate consumption fail to mention the non-kidney problems that likely also occurred.

Because it is so easy to overeat oxalates, chances are you may already be experiencing occasional oxalate-related aches and pains somewhere in your body. Do you tend to get a stiff neck? In those of us with dietary oxalate overload, pain, knots, or stiffness in the top of the shoulders or in the upper or lower back are typical. Some people experience chronic or intermittent joint inflammation, gout, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or a more generalized stiffness, often accompanied by a lack of pep.

Or perhaps you have long-standing injuries or chronic itching, tingling, or pain that never fully resolves. Your doctors can’t help you figure out what is going on; they seem to think you’re “just fine” and should just live with life’s little miseries. If any of this rings true for you—if you don’t feel “just fine”—this book may be your golden opportunity to turn things around.

Other seemingly small things can be indicators of oxalate overload, including itchy or dry eyes, eye floaters, excessive tartar on the teeth, tooth sensitivity, sensitive or frail skin, and odd things like pressure or pain in the loins, irritable bladder, urinary tract infections, frequent urination, or cloudy urine. Liver stress from oxalate overload can aggravate chemical sensitivity. Digestive problems like indigestion, reflux, bloating, excessive belching, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome are especially common. Additional symptoms can include shortness of breath, sinus problems, yeast infections, and even cold hands and feet.

Do you ever feel especially clumsy or occasionally have poor coordination? Do you get muscle spasms or eye twitches, or have memory or word-finding difficulties, headaches, or anxiety and panic disorder? Being neurotoxic, oxalates can get in—and on—your nerves. Oxalic acid chemically bonds to calcium and other minerals and interferes with cell energy production. Relentless oxalate consumption can cause oxalate to build up inside the body without obvious symptoms and may culminate years later as “old-age problems” such as bad bones, chronic pain, and vision and hearing loss. Oxalate deposits are also associated with brain cell damage that leads to Parkinson’s disease and dementia disorders.

You don’t have to have symptoms to have a disease, and oxalate toxicity is no exception. But a wide spectrum of potential symptoms can occur in the wake of oxalate overload, and each of us will (eventually) suffer from our own unique subset of them if we persist with high-oxalate eating. To make it easier to consider your own situation, you can take the Risks, Symptoms, and Exposure Self-Quiz (in the Resources section, page 275) or look over Table 10.1, which lists body systems and oxalate-associated symptoms. Keep reading to get the interesting details.

There are several factors that increase the likelihood that your high-oxalate diet may be leading to oxalate overload and symptoms, including:

•A diet low in calcium and other minerals (dairy-free and vegan diets are two examples)

•Frequent use of gut-irritating foods, including beans, bran, whole grains, quinoa

•A history of repeated use of antibiotic or antifungal medications

•Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications (NSAIDs)

•Obesity or diabetes

•Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), leaky gut, food sensitivities, bariatric surgery, or gut dysbiosis

•Frailty or other chronic non-oxalate illness

•Poor kidney health, history of kidney stones, family history of kidney disease.

As you will see in Part 2 of the book, simply trying a low-oxalate diet for a few months is another way to assess your situation.

The Hard Road to Enlightenment

Maybe, like me, you have always considered yourself a healthy eater. It was healthy eating that led to my ill health. I was beyond exhausted—unable to read with comprehension, unable to work. A high-tech sleep study showed that I was waking up 29 times every hour. Medications did nothing to improve the situation. I was stuck, and no one could help me. I had problems with joint pain and symptoms of genital burning, but I did not connect them to my exhaustion and sleep issues. It was my genital burning that, in 2009, led me to the Vulvar Pain (VP) Foundation, and under the fog of my heavy brain fatigue I decided to try the low-oxalate diet they recommended, hoping for relief from genital pain, not understanding the potential scope of effects or the long period needed for full recovery from oxalate damage.

In my ignorance, I drifted back to my beloved sweet potatoes and celery, and in 2013, I added kiwifruit to my diet in a desperate attempt to resolve my chronic constipation. After three months of a daily kiwi (sometimes two), my arthritis and stiffness became severe (all over again). This led to the brain-twisting recognition that dietary oxalate was related to my decades of joint pain. Grudgingly, I finally got serious about maintaining a low-oxalate diet.

Once I consistently shunned my go-to high-oxalate foods (for me, mainly sweet potatoes and chard), multiple personal miracles unfolded. The debilitating sleep disorder vanished, decades of pain and joint problems receded, and I started to feel younger. I never imagined anything like that was possible. The contrast between the years of intractable problems and then dramatic, lasting, and wholly unexpected benefits in the wake of the diet change was eye-opening.
Revue de presse
“Who knew that some so-called superfoods could be the opposite of healthy? The conventional advice to eat ‘mostly plants’ is seriously challenged by the reality that plants contain known toxins. Norton makes a compelling case that oxalates are the x-factor contributing to many mysterious health conditions.”—Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise

“What if your favorite superfood was actually a supervillain? Sally Norton masterfully pinpoints the changes in our food system and eating style that have turned a common natural occurring toxin into a potential public health crisis for people who are trying their best to eat well. Her simple and effective recommendations are grounded both in modern science and the principles of ancestral health.”—Aaron Blaisdell, PhD, UCLA Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience

“As a medical profession, we have only recently begun to realize how commonly we are seeing oxalate issues be a part of the presentation of a wide variety of chronic illnesses.

Robert H. Lustig,"Extrait
Once upon a time we were happy. Then the snake showed up. And we&#39ve been miserable ever since. Hieronymus Bosch&#39s painting Garden of Earthly Delights (circa 1500) is a triptych housed in the Prado in Madrid. It is an allegorical warning of what happens when we squander our birthright of happiness divined from God in one garden and move on to the pleasures of the flesh in the next garden, with the inevitable result of eternal damnation. Figures. Our most lauded goal in life-to be happy-is seemingly an illusion, out of reach for us common folk. Except the rich aren&#39t any happier. Happiness seems to be a mirage, something to chase after, to keep us turning over rocks, kissing frogs, and trying to fit keys into the magic lock.

But along the way, wandering through our own individual gardens of earthly delights in search of our seemingly unobtainable nirvanas, we&#39ve sure had a whole lot of fun. Or we&#39ve at least tried to. We buy shiny things, play Powerball, imbibe with friends or sometimes alone. So why are so many of us miserable? Are we destined just to sink further into the abyss of pleasure with no hope of extricating ourselves to find real happiness? Is it all futile? Lots of people have died trying to get to that magic place of contentment and inner peace, that thing called ""happiness."" But if we can&#39t get there, what&#39s the point?

What if I told you that happiness is right there in front of you, just behind the curtain of your own brain?

To some, an argument over the difference between pleasure and happiness might seem like a straw man, a false argument not really worth having. Hey, they both feel good; why should you care? And pleasure is here, now. Happiness . . . maybe not so much, and not so soon.

But it does matter. And not just to you but to all of society. Explaining the differences between these two otherwise positive emotions form the narrative arc of this book.

Terms of Endearment

Pleasure takes many forms and has many synonyms: ""gratification,"" ""amusement,"" ""indulgence,"" ""titillation,"" ""turn-on."" But the experience of pleasure is the visceral readout of activity of a specific brain area known as the ""reward pathway."" In fact, pleasure is actually two phenomena in one. First, one experiences the motivation for a given reward. Second, one experiences the consummation of that reward as the visceral experience we call pleasure. For simplicity, I will call it reward so both the social science and the neuroscience can effectively be treated as one.

The old adage goes, ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" Same for happiness. Happiness is in the brain of the experiencer. And it too has its own brain area, known as the ""contentment pathway."" But as a philosophical concept, happiness has a long history and has been tangled up with the history of society for as long as there&#39s been society. Happiness consists of a grab bag of definitions that have changed and morphed over time. The root of the word, ""hap,"" means luck. And we see this etymological root in other words relating to chance occurrence: for instance, happenstance or perhaps. Early societies weren&#39t very happy; after all, with famine, plague, and war, they had a lot to be unhappy about. Happiness was chance, fleeting, and seemed to alight on only a select few in any given society.

The God Factor

Religion has been the arbiter of both pleasure and happiness since there was religion. By no means is the brief history that follows meant to be exhaustive, but understanding where we came from can help us determine where we are going.

The Jewish tradition says that the study of the Torah is the path to happiness, because ""all its paths are peace,"" and by following the law one could not help but achieve happiness. The Greeks are on record for jump-starting both the pleasure and happiness industries. In the third century BCE they wrestled the concept of happiness away from the concept of hedonism, the philosophy that said that the goal of life was net pleasure (pleasure minus pain). Aristotle expanded on the Jewish concept and argued that happiness consisted of being a good ethical person, a manifestation of reason and virtue, and coined the term eudemonia, a synonym for ""contentment"" (the concept on which this book is based). Zeno, the father of Stoicism, took this up a notch to say that unhappiness resulted from errors of judgment and that the true sage was immune to unhappiness; the converse of this was, of course, that if you were unhappy, you were no sage. Epicurus weighed in to say that happiness was a state of peace, absence of fear, absence of pain, and a life surrounded by friends-threads of which remain with us today.

Then came Christianity, which said many things, one of which was that happiness will occur there and later as opposed to here and now. Life is unpleasant, but if you live it as an upstanding Christian, heaven awaits. Pleasure was the devil on earth, and pain in the form of humility and service was the path to a happy afterlife, a gift from God. Islam refined the concept to turning it into a struggle, the war between good and evil on earth, and one would be rewarded with happiness in the afterlife. And the Baha&#39i faith has its feet in both camps by stating that we humans are noble from the start and capable of continual spiritual growth both in this world and in the afterlife. So make the world a better place now and heaven a better place later.

The Eastern religions take a slightly different approach, by establishing the methods for achieving happiness now rather than later, because there is no later-at least, not the heaven of Western theology. Hinduism proffered the theory of reincarnation as a means of ""getting it right""-that the goal of religion was to adhere to a way of stopping the process of death-rebirth (so you don&#39t come back as a frog). Buddhism added specific practices allowing us to break free of this cycle to achieve ""nirvana,"" or liberation. Thus, pleasure has historically been the cultural antagonist to achieving happiness. In terms of the science, nothing&#39s changed.

Indeed, there is not one definition of ""happiness."" What it means to be happy is quite different, depending on the times in which you live, your religious and cultural affiliations, and likely the language you use. For instance, some languages define ""happiness"" as ""good luck and favorable circumstances"" (i.e., out of your control), while in others ""happiness"" refers to ""favorable internal feeling states"" (somewhat in your control). Obviously, this makes it very hard to write about, because the definitions and the criteria for inclusion have been a moving target.

Happy Endings?

Happiness is what most people say they really want: the spouse who can manage those things you can&#39t; the house with the porch and the white picket fence; the two matched children (one boy, one girl) who get all the awards in high school and go on to Ivy League colleges; seeing the world with your family; having a retirement nest egg (I always liked the Prudential commercial with psychologist Dan Gilbert that states, ""Retirement is paying yourself for what you like to do""); and growing old with your spouse without infirmity. Then again, most parents today simply wish for minimal psychiatric bills, no trips to rehab and no police record, good colleges on their children&#39s résumés, and offspring who are neither bullies nor bullied. Yet virtually any hallmarks of happiness are noticeably absent from most of our written history, in part because who&#39d want to read it? That&#39s kind of the point. Happiness is what we say we want. But reading about someone else&#39s happiness can get kind of boring. Lack of conflict doesn&#39t make for a very good page-turner or miniseries.

Since the Renaissance, happiness has been the main stated goal of life, rather than being on good behavior to reserve yourself a seat in the afterlife. When asked their primary desire, people across the world, from the U.S. to Slovenia, have put happiness at the very top of their lists. But despite our five-hundred-year eyes on the prize, as a whole we consistently miss the target. The self-help section of any bookstore (that is, any bookstore that is left: their disappearance is itself a marker of our collective loss of happiness) is chock-full of tomes that explore the achievement, value, or consequences of pleasure or happiness in isolation of each other. The publication of books on happiness has become a lucrative niche market, to be sure.

Pop Happiness

In the twentieth century, Martin Seligman and his colleagues on the beaches of Mexico birthed an entirely new field called ""positive psychology,"" which aims to get us to focus on what is right with our lives rather than what is wrong. Positive psychology studies positive emotions, positive traits, and positive institutions in an attempt to make your life more, well, positive. The idea is to capitalize on your strengths rather than to emphasize your weaknesses or detriments. (To lead a productive and fulfilling life, you can take an online authentic happiness test.) Seligman argues that your happiness is based on who you are intrinsically, voluntary actions, and your circumstances. Tal Ben-Shahar&#39s Positive Psychology class has been and continues to be the most subscribed undergraduate lecture course at Harvard University (maybe because it&#39s an easy A?). Clearly, intelligence and youth don&#39t guarantee happiness.

Sonja Lyubomirsky takes positive psychology even further by breaking the driving forces of happiness into a pie chart: she states that happiness is 50 percent genetics (set point), 40 percent up to your own behaviors, and 10 percent environment (national or cultural region, demographics, gender, ethnicity, experiences, and other life status variables such as marital status, education level, health, and income). More recently studies put the heritability of happiness (i.e., satisfaction with life and well-being) somewhere between 32 and 36 percent. One genome-wide analysis found two genetic variants associated with subjective well-being (i.e., contentment), while yet another report suggests there are at least twenty more, which implies that we won&#39t be genetically engineering happiness very soon. The argument that your state of happiness is only 10 percent based on your circumstances/environment becomes difficult to parse considering that we live in our environments 24/7 and are constantly barraged with commercials of what we need to be happy.

Numerous pop psychology books have popped up, arguably because people want to know how to get happier. Each of these books views happiness as one phenomenon, and most confuse pleasure with happiness. Until you can distinguish the difference between these two emotions, you can&#39t recognize either one as unique and you can&#39t understand, let alone fix, the problem for yourself or for your family.

One Origin of the Confusion

If you google ""happiness,"" here&#39s what you get: ""pleasure, joy, exhilaration, bliss, contentedness, delight, enjoyment, satisfaction, contentment, felicity."" Note the conflation of the concept of pleasure with the concept of happiness in this definition. Where did this conundrum come from, anyway? Who conflated pleasure with happiness in the first place? And how is it that governments and businesses have been able to harness this confusion for their own purposes? (See Chapters 13 and 14.) Here&#39s one quick and dirty explanation of how words make all the difference. Aristotle argued ""the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of pain is a first principle; for it is for the sake of this that we do all that we do."" Enter eighteenth-century political philosopher-economist Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was a curious fellow hell-bent on quantifying and scientifically explaining individual human experience by constructing a tally sheet of happiness. He might be called the godfather of utilitarianism, the term John Stuart Mill coined in the nineteenth century to describe the philosophy of increasing net world happiness as the primary goal of human existence. Bentham argued that each person should consider others&#39 welfare as seriously as his own. But in the process, Bentham bastardized Aristotle: ""Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure, and that just happens to be a fact . . . benefit, advantage, pleasure, good, or happiness, all of which ultimately comes to the same thing."" Under Bentham&#39s rubric, anything that minimized pain and maximized pleasure by its very nature increased happiness. Carrying Bentham&#39s rubric forward into the neuroscientific age, anything that triggers dopamine or opioid release and action (see Chapter 3) would equally qualify as generating happiness.

Even academics have confused the concepts of pleasure and happiness. For instance, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that there are two separate ""accounts"" of happiness: (1) hedonism (maximization of pleasure), and (2) the life satisfaction theory, giving them both equal standing. What? Since when is hedonism even in the same room as happiness? Aristotle would be turning over in his grave.

Now that you understand the history of the words themselves, how they have been confused with each other, and how even pop psychologists and Google can&#39t tell the difference, let me now make clear how I am defining them, because the brain science says so. For the rest of this book, pleasure, derived from the French plaisir for ""to please,"" is defined as the concept of gratification or reward. The keys to this definition are: (1) it is immediate, (2) it provides some level of excitement or amusement, and (3) it is dependent on circumstance. Conversely, happiness is defined as the Aristotelian concept of eudemonia-that is, ""contentment"" or well-being or human flourishing, or, as in the introductory quote from Yeats, ""growth""-physical and/or spiritual. The keys to this definition are: (1) it&#39s about life, not the afterlife, (2) it&#39s not prone to acute changes in one&#39s life, and (3) it is unrelated to circumstance, so anyone can be happy, not just the rich and the powerful.

Unraveling the Threads

These two similar yet conflicting aspects of our neurobiology interact with each other, and it is this interaction that serves as the fulcrum on which our lives, our self-worth, and our internal compasses are balanced (see Chapter 10). Our current collective wisdom does not distinguish between reward and contentment at the etymological level, and fails to acknowledge the personal and societal consequences of mistaking one for the other at the biochemical level. And there are consequences, to be sure. That&#39s what this book is all about. Because chronic excessive reward eventually leads to both addiction and depression; the two most unhappy states of the human condition.

This confusion also belies the basis for many of today&#39s most successful marketing strategies (see Chapter 13). Over the past forty years, the dark underbelly of American enterprise has waged war on the American psyche. City College of New York sociologist Nicholas Freudenberg coined the term ""corporate consumption complex"" for the six biggest industries that sell us various hedonic substances (tobacco, alcohol, food) and behavioral triggers (guns, cars, energy). Add to that the consumer electronics sector, which further takes advantage of our neurobiology, and wrap it all up in some slick Madison Avenue packaging, and you have an unbeatable recipe for corporate profit. In fact, their recipes are continuing to improve: as the science of reward is elaborated and becomes more precise, new techniques in neuromarketing are now becoming mainstream. And as corporations have profited big from increased consumption of virtually everything with a price tag promising happiness, we have lost big-time. America has devolved from the aspirational, achievement-oriented ""city on a hill"" we once were, into the addicted and depressed society that we&#39ve now become. Because we abdicated happiness for pleasure. Because pleasure got cheap.
Revue de presse
""Our health, resistance to disease, and ability to function on a day-to-day basis have essentially been hijacked, all in the name of corporate profits. Dr. Lustig explores how industry has manipulated our most deep-seated survival instincts to motivate our food choices in a way that directly undermines our ability to survive. But more importantly, The Hacking of the American Mind eloquently reveals how we can disengage from this influence and re-establish ourselves on a path to wellness.""
—David Perlmutter, MD, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller, Grain Brain and Brain Maker

“A provocative, persuasive plea to stop seeking the wrong kind of happiness. Take it from the neuroscientist/endocrinologist who sounded the alarm about sugar: chasing rewards is far less rewarding than finding contentment.”
—Adam Grant, author of New York Times bestsellers Originals and Give and Take, and coauthor of the New York Times bestseller Option B

""Robert Lustig takes on one of the greatest paradoxes of our time: how can it be that we have more sources of pleasure than ever before in human history, and yet are increasingly sick, broke, and unhappy? By deftly weaving together neuroscience, history, economics, and more, he provides a much-needed explanation of how the &#39pernicious peddling of pleasure&#39 causes real happiness to elude so many of us — and also provides a desperately needed roadmap for escaping the pleasure trap.""
—Sharon Begley, coauthor of theNew York Timesbest seller The Emotional Life of Your Brain

""Pleasure and happiness are not the same thing – as our addictions to everything from unhealthy food to cellphones show. In this book, Dr. Lustig unpacks the science of pleasure versus happiness to explain the true causes of the last 40 years of addiction, depression, and disease. The good news is that the solution is easy — well, maybe not so easy — put down your cellphone. And sleep. You’ll be happier, and you’ll live longer!""
—Arianna Huffington, author of the New York Times best seller The Sleep Revolution

""Dr. Robert Lustig examines our culture of illness, an industry-created fog that, despite our best efforts to cope, has left us stressed, isolated, addicted, and depressed. With The Hacking of the American Mind, he empowers us with the science of mind, brain, and love in a delightful, insightful, and humorous way. You can live by pursuing pleasure, sugar-coated as &#39happiness,&#39 or you can read this book.""
