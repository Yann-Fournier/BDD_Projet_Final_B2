Cora-Line Marchiani,"Un livre constructif 5/5

Quand on est dans ce cas, on se sent concerné dès le début, rien que ça, ça aide déjà à se sentir moins seul(e). Les conseils prodigués sont pertinents et tout à fait à propos, on sent le vécu. Comme quoi on peut tout à fait s’en sortir, petit à petit, même quand on pense ne pas voir le bout du tunnel.

On s&#39y reconnaît 5/5

Je n&#39ai pas d&#39enfants, mais je suis clairement en burn-out.
Et le lire m&#39a fait du bien. Parce que l&#39autrice me comprenait, qu&#39elle a permis de mettre des mots sur ce que je n&#39arrivais pas à exprimer. Parce qu&#39elle a mis une explication, une description derrière ce que je ressentais. Parce qu&#39elle m&#39a fait comprendre que je n&#39étais pas seule. Qu&#39elle m&#39a permis de voir un espoir que ça irait mieux, qu&#39elle m&#39a aidée à mettre le pied à l&#39étrier, à faire le premier pas vers la guérison, à me remotiver en écoutant mon corps et mon esprit.
Et elle reste humble. Elle n&#39essaie pas de se substituer à un professionnel, rappelle même qu&#39il ne faut pas hésiter à aller les voir. Elle permet d&#39y voir plus clair, et donne des pistes pour faire le point, et pour alléger notre esprit.
Les exemples pris sont sur le burn-out parental, mais les idées peuvent être adaptées à d&#39autres types de burn-out.
Donc clairement, je le recommande et n&#39hésiterai pas à le relire si j&#39en ressens le besoin à nouveau.

Vraiment super ! 5/5

J&#39ai adoré ! Hyper complet et constructif. On se sent entendu et compris, l&#39auteure donne de très bons conseils. Un livre que je recommande fortement à tous les parents épuisés (et même à ceux touchés par le burn-out en général) !
Merci !",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/nao7och9fpfs1o1dqkthtnpip7._SY600_.jpg

Michael Nehls MD PhD,"“If Dr. Nehls is right, his theory here will be as important as Dr. Sigmund Freud’s discovery of the subconscious, if not more so.”
—From the foreword by Naomi Wolf, author of The Bodies of Others
 
“Michael Nehls has written a provocative book arguing that the COVID-19 generation in particular will ultimately be deficient in memory and cognition, due to the combination of brainwashing and toxic exposures, launched by a self-appointed technocratic elite group and applied to all of humanity. The book provides detailed scientific support for the direct effects on the hippocampus that lead to these dire outcomes. Fascinating and terrifying at the same time.""

The most wonderful, heartbreakingly gorgeous novel of the year. -- Elizabeth Day ― THE MAIL ON SUNDAY, YOU MAGAZINE

It is impossible to read this novel and not be moved. It is also impossible not to laugh out loud... Mason pulls off something extraordinary in this huge-hearted novel, alchemising an unbearable anguish into something tender and hilarious and redemptive and wise, without ever undermining its gravity or diminishing its pain. -- Clare Clark ― GUARDIAN

Inspired storytelling... a devastating and sharply funny love story... it is Martha&#39s voice itself - her woeful deadpan narration always teetering between the comic, the tragic and the downright unlikable - that makes this novel sing. -- Julie Myerson ― OBSERVER

Probably the best book you&#39ll read this year... Brilliant, bleak, hilarious: the book of the summer. -- Natasha Poliszczuk ― THE MAIL ON SUNDAY

Sorrow and Bliss, Meg Mason&#39s first novel to be published in the UK, is as wonderful as everyone says it is. Blunt, tender, hilarious, and so very good on the trickiness of families, it is that rare perfect balance of fun (commercial) and difficult (literary), and exactly the book to read right now, when you need a laugh, but want to cry. -- Eva Wiseman ― THE OBSERVER MAGAZINE

Summer&#39s must-read novel... We can&#39t recommend Sorrow And Bliss highly enough. -- Francesca Brown ― STYLIST

A Fleabag-esque novel being raved about by Gillian Anderson and Ann Patchett... Expect this one to light up the WhatsApp chats. -- Louisa McGillicuddy ― SUNDAY TIMES STYLE

You know that book that only comes along every so often, that seems to unite everyone who has read it in a sort of delirious fervour? Sorrow and Bliss is that book... It&#39s utterly compelling and darkly funny: the book you have to read this summer. -- Jessie Thompson ― EVENING STANDARD

Meg Mason has achieved something remarkable - Sorrow and Bliss is a raucously funny, beautifully written, emotionbashing book about love, family and life&#39s curveballs that leaves you, satisfyingly, with what feels like wisdom forged in fire. -- Siobhan Murphy ― THE TIMES

This is a story of mental illness reflected through the prism of an uproarious, big-hearted family comedy. It is fiercely intelligent and absolutely sublime. -- Anne Cunningham ― IRISH INDEPENDENT

Rarely have the excoriating effects of mental illness been articulated quite so beautifully - as heartbreaking as it&#39s funny, Sorrow And Bliss is one for the keeper shelves. -- Sarra Manning ― RED MAGAZINE

Deeply moving but also darkly funny, Mason has created the sort of story that you savour the last pages of and long for once it&#39s over. -- Olivia Ovenden ― ESQUIRE

Completely brilliant, I loved it. I think every girl and woman should read it. ― Gillian Anderson

Sorrow and Bliss is a brilliantly faceted and extremely funny book about depression that engulfed me in the way I&#39m always hoping to be to be engulfed by novels. While I was reading it, I was making a list of all the people I wanted to send it to, until I realized that I wanted to send it to everyone I know. ― Ann Patchett

Sharp yet humane, and jaw-droppingly funny, this is the kind of novel you will want to press into the hands of everyone you know. Mason has an extraordinary talent for dialogue and character, and her understanding of how much poignancy a reader can take is profound. A masterclass on family, damage and the bonds of love: as soon as I finished it, I started again. ― Jessie Burton

Sorrow and Bliss is a thing of beauty. Astute observations on marriage, motherhood, family, and mental illness are threaded through a story that is by turns devastating and restorative. Every sentence rings true. I will be telling everyone I love to read this book. ― Sara Collins, author of THE CONFESSIONS OF FRANNIE LANGTON

A sharply observed, darkly hilarious and merciless portrait of a thoroughly messed-up family. Patrick Melrose meets Fleabag. Brilliant. ― Clare Chambers, author of SMALL PLEASURES

Meg Mason writes about the slow bleed of life-long depression with candour, humour and stark precision. Sorrow and Bliss is about what happens when your illness pushes everyone away - leaving you with only the sorest parts of yourself for company. It will, as the title suggests, shatter your heart, before mending it with infinite love. I&#39ve never read anything like it and will be pressing it into the hands of every reader I know. ― Pandora Sykes

Compulsively readable, Sorrow and Bliss is one of the funniest books I&#39ve read... Martha is such a brilliant, singular creation - as Patrick says, ""The idea that you might be ordinary is unbearable"" - that it is more interesting to imagine not the characters that have inspired her but the ones she will inspire. -- Francesca Steele ― I NEWSPAPER

Sharp, stylish and revelatory, this novel is sure to be one of the big success stories of the year. -- Sarah Gilmartin ― IRISH TIMES

Consistently funny and sharp and dark: it&#39s wonderful. ― Charlotte Mendelson, author of ALMOST ENGLISH

[A] razor-sharp exploration of mental health and identity. Hilarious and heartbreaking, this is best enjoyed over a large glass of rosé on a sunny afternoon. ― COSMOPOLITAN

The unforgettable novel you need to read this summer. ― TIMES BOOKS NEWSLETTER

I&#39ve never read a novel about the impact of mental illness on the life of a woman, and those around her, like this. It is simply brilliant, and Martha&#39s voice is a joy: hilarious, sharp and devastating. A must read. -- Alice O&#39Keefe ― THE BOOKSELLER, Editor&#39s Choice

Nina Stibbe meets Fleabag -- Charlotte Heathcote ― DAILY EXPRESS

Blisteringly good... a novel that manages to be psychologically complex, yet still an utter joy to read. Sorrow and Bliss bristles with great one-liners and setpieces that are sometimes alarming, sometimes comic, but more often both. ― READER&#39S DIGEST

Heartbreakingly sad and yet screamingly funny. -- Deirdre O&#39Brien ― BEST

I very much enjoyed Meg Mason&#39s witty, affecting Sorrow and Bliss. -- David Nicholls ― GUARDIAN - Hot Summer Books feature

This is a beautiful depiction of a marriage, with all of its ugliness and joy. But its also a brilliant depiction of a whole family, wounded by a legacy of mental illness, and tender, witty, and loving, in spite of it, So funny, and so very, very sad. ― Abigail Dean, bestselling author of GIRL A

An incredibly funny and devastating debut ... enlivened, often, by a madcap energy. Yet it still manages to be sensitive and heartfelt, and to offer a nuanced portrayal of what it means to try to make amends and change. ― Guardian

With its finger on the modern pulse, Sorrow and Bliss blisters with its prose which manages to be both hilarious and heartbreaking in the same line. I kept having to stop to underline sentences. It reminded me of a cross between Fleabag and My Year of Rest and Relaxation, but really, Meg Mason has crafted a protagonist who feels completely her own person. Fresh and alive. ― Jodie Chapman, author of ANOTHER LIFE

Sorrow and Bliss is a moving and poignant story about mental illness, family and love. It made me laugh and cry; a bittersweet read that will stay with you for a long time. ― Libby Page, bestselling author of The Lido

I devoured this book, with all its humour and pain and cock-eyed hope. It&#39s a funny and excruciating portrayal of mental illness, family dysfunction and love, all told through the point of view of a narrator who is in turn frustrating and endearing, but always fascinating. I adored it from the first page. ― Julie Cohen, author of TOGETHER

Sorrow and Bliss is hilarious, haunting, and utterly captivating. Meg Mason has created a heroine as prickly as Bernadette in Where&#39d You Go, Bernadette. Her humor is as arch and wise as the best work of Joan Didion and Rachel Cusk, yet completely original. What a thrilling new voice! ― Amanda Eyre Ward, New York Times bestselling author of THE JETSETTERS

Brutal, tender, funny, this novel - a portrait of love in all of its many incarnations - came alive for me from the very first page. I saw myself here. I saw the people I love. I am changed by this book. ― Mary Beth Keane, New York Times bestselling author of ASK AGAIN, YES

So dark, so funny, so true. You will see your sad, struggling, triumphant self in this deeply affecting novel ― Laura Zigman, author of SEPARATION ANXIETY

This is a romance, true, but a real one. It&#39s modern love up against the confusing, sad aches of mental illness, with all its highs, lows, humour and misery. Comparisons to Sally Rooney will be made, but Mason&#39s writing is less self-conscious than Rooney&#39s, and perhaps more mature. Her character work is outstanding, and poignant-the hairline fractures, contradictions and nuances of the middle-class family dynamic are painstakingly rendered with moving familiarity and black humour, resulting in a combination as devastating and sharply witty as Phoebe Waller-Bridge&#39s Fleabag. ― Bookseller+Publisher

Exploring the multifaceted hardships of mental illness and the frustrating inaccuracy of diagnoses, medications, and treatments, Sorrow and Bliss is darkly comic and deeply heartfelt. Much like the narrator of Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, Martha&#39s voice is acerbic, witty, and raw. Fans of Marian Keyes should put this on their to-read lists.
― Booklist

Martha&#39s anecdotes, simultaneously funny and sad, are stacked with observations that alternate between brutally cutting-especially when directed at her mother and at the patient and supportive Patrick-and aching, as when her oblique descriptions of her sister&#39s growing family increasingly belie her true feelings about motherhood. Witty and stark, Martha&#39s emotionally affecting story will delight fans of Sally Rooney. ― Publishers Weekly, Starred Review

Martha Friel, the narrator of this improbably charming novel about mental illness, will have you chortling and reading lines aloud. ― PEOPLE

Meg Mason has the ability to keep the reader alongside and sharing in the hope every step of the way. ― WOMAN & HOME

Deliciously dark and fantastically funny. ― THE SUNDAY POST

Martha tells the sotry of the end of her marriage, her fiercely close relationship with her sister and her terrifying experiences of mental chaos in this brilliant, painful and unexpectedly comic novel. Narrated with insight and sensitivity by actor Emilia Fox, it looks set to become one of the hits of the year. -- Alex Clark ― FINANCIAL TIMES, Audio Books review round up

A viciously funny novel about mental illness that combines acute social satire with warmth and insight. -- Claire Allfree ― METRO

Without a doubt the book of the summer.By turns dryly funny and breathtakingly sad, it is a compulsive, exquisitely written look at mental illness and relationships. -- Gwendolyn Smith ― I NEWSPAPER - #1 pick in summer reading roud up

Brilliant, bleak and hysterically funny. Tackling mental illness, families, sisterly love and failing marriages... it&#39s universally being proclaimed ""The book of the summer"". -- Suzannah Ramsdale ― EVENING STANDARD

Meg Mason&#39s debut novel is tender and dark as a bruise, coloured with complicated emotions but also wryly funny. And, as it takes a candid look at the way mental illness can derail a person, it also brims with hope as Martha looks to the future, determined to pick up the pieces of her broken life. -- Eithne Farry ― SUNDAY EXPRESS S MAGAZINE

Unputdownable - one of the darkest, sharpest novels you will find this year. -- Nadine O&#39Regan ― THE SUNDAY BUSINESS POST

This debut from Meg Mason is a brilliant, many-faceted diamond of a book. ― SAINSBURY&#39S MAGAZINE

The most recommended book of the summer, and with good reason. Meg Mason&#39s novel about mental health, marriage and sisterhood is told in a singular voice of wry wit and blackly comic frankness. One of those &#39read it in one sitting and tell all your friends&#39 kind of books. -- Jessie Thompson ― EVENING STANDARD, Best Fiction of 2021

It is a subtle and sensitive writer who can make you shout with laughter as she wrings your heart. Mason&#39s characters are exquisitely drawn. Sorrow, yes, but also utter bliss. -- Rose Shepherd ― SAGA

Must-read stuff: clever, sparkling and funny. ― STRONG WORDS

This account of a life derailed by mental illness is both darkly funny and deeply touching... A brilliantly faceted and funny book that will engulf you.
― BEST MONTHLY

The summer of 2021&#39s most (justifiably) hyped novel... is a beautifully paced, darkly funny, heart-thuddingly moving portrait of family, marriage and chronic illness. Its pithy protagonist-narrator, Martha, is a memorable creation. -- Patricia Nicol ― THE SUNDAY TIMES, Best Fiction of the Year

Simply unforgettable. -- Francesca Steele ― I NEWSPAPER, Best Books of 2021

The summer&#39s word-of-mouth hit was Meg Mason&#39s Sorrow and Bliss (W&N), a wisecracking black comedy of mental anguish and eccentric family life focused on a woman who should have everything to live for. -- Justine Jordan ― GUARDIAN, Best Books of 2021

Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason is a knockout. An unnamed mental health illness and a struggling marriage are both rendered by Mason with devastating honesty and laugh-out-loud wit. -- Louise O&#39Neill ― IRISH EXAMINER
Quatrième de couverture
Everyone tells Martha Friel she is clever and beautiful, a brilliant writer who has been loved every day of her adult life by one man, her husband Patrick. A gift, her mother once said, not everybody gets.

So why is everything broken? Why is Martha - on the edge of 40 - friendless, practically jobless and so often sad? And why did Patrick decide to leave?

Maybe she is just too sensitive, someone who finds it harder to be alive than most people. Or maybe - as she has long believed - there is something wrong with her. Something that broke when a little bomb went off in her brain, at 17, and left her changed in a way that no doctor or therapist has ever been able to explain.

Forced to return to her childhood home to live with her dysfunctional, bohemian parents (but without the help of her devoted, foul-mouthed sister Ingrid), Martha has one last chance to find out whether a life is ever too broken to fix - or whether, maybe, by starting over, she will get to write a better ending for herself.

Chapter One
 The World of Borderline Personality Disorder
 Everything looked and sounded unreal. Nothing was what it is. That&#39s what I wanted-to be alone with myself in another world where truth is untrue and life can hide from itself.
 -From Long Day&#39s Journey into Night, by Eugene O&#39Neill
 Dr. White thought it would all be relatively straightforward. Over the five years he had been treating Jennifer, she&#39d had few medical problems. Her stomach complaints were probably due to gastritis, he thought, so he treated her with antacids. But when her stomach pains became more intense despite treatment and routine testing proved normal, Dr. White admitted Jennifer to the hospital.
 After a thorough medical workup, Dr. White inquired about stresses Jennifer might be experiencing at work and home. She readily acknowledged that her job as a personnel manager for a major corporation was very pressured, but as she put it, ""Many people have pressure jobs."" She also revealed that her home life was more hectic recently. She was trying to cope with her husband&#39s busy legal practice while tending to the responsibilities of being a mother. But she doubted the connection of these factors to her stomach pains.
 When Dr. White recommended that Jennifer seek psychiatric consultation, she initially resisted. It was only after her discomfort turned into stabs of pain that she reluctantly agreed to see the psychiatrist Dr. Gray.
 They met a few days later. Appearing childlike and younger than her twenty-eight years, Jennifer lay in bed in a hospital room that had been transformed from an anonymous cubicle into a personalized lair. A stuffed animal sat next to her in bed, and another lay on the nightstand beside several pictures of her husband and son. Get-well cards were meticulously displayed in a line along the windowsill, flanked by flower arrangements.
 At first Jennifer was very formal, answering all of Dr. Gray&#39s questions with great seriousness. Then she joked about how her job was ""driving me to see a shrink."" The longer she talked, the sadder she looked. Her voice became less domineering and more childlike.
 She told him how a job promotion was exacting more demands-new responsibilities that were making her feel insecure. Her five-year-old son was starting school, which was proving to be a difficult separation for both of them. Conflicts with Allan, her husband, were increasing. She described rapid mood swings and trouble sleeping. Her appetite had steadily decreased and she was losing weight. Her concentration, energy, and sex drive had all diminished.
 Dr. Gray recommended a trial of antidepressant medications, which improved her gastric symptoms and seemed to normalize her sleeping patterns. In a few days she was ready for discharge and agreed to continue outpatient therapy.
 Over the following weeks, Jennifer talked more about her upbringing. Reared in a small town, she was the daughter of a prominent businessman and his socialite wife. Her father, an elder in the local church, demanded perfection from his daughter and her two older brothers, constantly reminding the children that the community was scrutinizing their behavior. Jennifer&#39s grades, her behavior, even her thoughts were never quite good enough. She feared her father, yet constantly-and unsuccessfully-sought his approval. Her mother remained passive and detached. Her parents evaluated her friends, often deeming them unacceptable. As a result, she had few friends and even fewer dates.
 Jennifer described her roller-coaster emotions, which seemed to have worsened when she started college. She began drinking for
the first time, sometimes to excess. Without warning, she would feel lonely and depressed and then high with happiness and love. On occasion, she would burst out in rage against her friends-fits of anger that she had somehow managed to suppress as a child.
 It was at about this time that she also began to appreciate the attention of men, something she had previously always avoided. Though she enjoyed being desired, she always felt she was ""fooling"" or tricking them somehow. After she began dating a man, she would sabotage the relationship by stirring up conflict.
 She met Allan as he was completing his law studies. He pursued her relentlessly and refused to be driven away when she tried to back off. He liked to choose her clothes and advise her on how to walk, how to talk, and how to eat nutritiously. He insisted she accompany him to the gym where he frequently worked out.
 ""Allan gave me an identity,"" she explained. He advised her on how to interact with his society partners and clients, when to be aggressive, when to be demure. She developed a cast of ""repertoire players""-characters or roles whom she could call to the stage on cue.
 They married, at Allan&#39s insistence, before the end of her junior year. She quit school and began working as a receptionist, but her employer recognized her intelligence and promoted her to more responsible jobs.
 At home, however, things began to sour. Allan&#39s career and his interest in bodybuilding caused him to spend more time away from home, which Jennifer hated. Sometimes she would start fights just to keep him home a little longer. Frequently, she would provoke him into hitting her. Afterward she would invite him to make love to her.
 Jennifer had few friends. She devalued women as gossipy and uninteresting. She hoped that her son Scott&#39s birth, coming two years after her marriage, would provide the comfort she lacked. She felt her son would always love her and always be there for her. But the demands of an infant were overwhelming, and after a while, Jennifer decided to return to work.
 Despite frequent praise and successes at work, Jennifer continued to feel insecure, that she was ""faking it."" She became sexually involved with a coworker who was almost forty years her senior.
 ""Usually I&#39m okay,"" she told Dr. Gray. ""But there&#39s another side that takes over and controls me. I&#39m a good mother. But my other side makes me a whore; it makes me act crazy!""
 Jennifer continued to deride herself, particularly when alone; during times of solitude, she would feel abandoned, which she attributed to her own unworthiness. Anxiety would threaten to overwhelm her unless she found some kind of release. Sometimes she&#39d indulge in eating binges, once consuming an entire bowl of cookie batter. She would spend long hours gazing at pictures of her son and husband, trying to ""keep them alive in my brain.""
 Jennifer&#39s physical appearance at her therapy sessions fluctuated dramatically. When coming directly from work, she would dress in a business suit that exuded maturity and sophistication. But on her days off, she showed up in short pants and knee socks, with her hair in braids; at these appointments she acted like a little girl with a high-pitched voice and used a more limited vocabulary.
 Sometimes she would transform right before Dr. Gray&#39s eyes. She could be insightful and intelligent, working collaboratively toward greater self-understanding, and then become a child, coquettish and seductive, pronouncing herself incapable of functioning in the adult world. She could be charming and ingratiating or manipulative and hostile. She could storm out of one session, vowing never to return, and at the next session cower with the fear that Dr. Gray would refuse to see her again.
 Jennifer felt like a child clad in the armor of an adult. She was perplexed at the respect she received from other adults; she expected them to see through her disguise at any moment, revealing her to be an empress with no clothes. She needed someone to love and protect her from the world. She desperately sought closeness, but when someone came too close, she ran.
  Jennifer is afflicted with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). She is not alone. Studies estimate that as many as 19 million or more Americans (3 to 6 percent of the population) exhibit primary symptoms of BPD, and many studies suggest this figure is an underestimation. Approximately 10 percent of psychiatric outpatients and 20 percent of inpatients, and between 15 and 25 percent of all patients seeking psychiatric care, are diagnosed with the disorder. It is one of the most common of all of the personality disorders.
 Yet, despite its prevalence, BPD remains relatively unknown to the general public. Ask the man on the street about anxiety, depression, or alcoholism, and he would probably be able to provide a sketchy, if not technically accurate, description of the illness. Ask him to define Borderline Personality Disorder, and he would probably give you a blank stare. Ask an experienced mental health clinician about the disorder, on the other hand, and you will get a much different response. She will sigh deeply and exclaim that of all her psychiatric patients, borderline patients are the most difficult, the most dreaded, and the most to be avoided-more than those with schizophrenia, more than those suffering from alcoholism or substance abuse, more than any other patient. For decades BPD has been lurking as a kind of ""Third World"" of mental illness-indistinct, massive, and vaguely threatening.
 BPD has been underrecognized partly because the diagnosis is still relatively new. For years, ""borderline"" was used as a catchall category for patients who did not fit more established diagnoses. People described as borderline seemed more ill than neurotic patients (who experience severe anxiety secondary to emotional conflict), yet less ill than psychotic patients (whose detachment from reality makes normal functioning impossible).
 The disorder also coexists with, and borders on, other mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, schizophrenia, somatization disorder (hypochondriasis), dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcoholism, drug abuse (including nicotine dependence), eating disorders, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, hysteria, sociopathy, and other personality disorders.
 Though the term borderline was first coined in the 1930s, the condition was not clearly defined until the 1970s. For years, psychiatrists could not seem to agree on the separate existence of the syndrome, much less on the specific symptoms necessary for diagnosis. But as more and more people began to seek therapy for a unique set of life problems, the parameters of the disorder crystallized. In 1980, the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder was first defined in the American Psychiatric Association&#39s third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), the diagnostic ""bible"" of the psychiatric profession. Since then, several revisions of the DSM have been produced, the most recent being DSM-5, published in 2013. Though various schools within psychiatry still quarrel over the exact nature, causes, and treatment of BPD, the disorder is officially recognized as a major mental health problem in America today. Indeed, BPD patients consume a greater percentage of mental health services than those with just about any other diagnosis. Additionally, studies corroborate that about 90 percent of patients with the BPD diagnosis also share at least one other major psychiatric diagnosis.BPD is also often connected to significant medical diseases, especially in women. These include chronic headaches and other pain, arthritis, and diseases of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, pulmonary, hepatic, immune, and oncological systems.In 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives designated May as Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month. And yet, unfortunately, current government-sponsored research on BPD represents only a fraction of the work directed to less common disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
 In many ways, the borderline syndrome has been to psychiatry what a virus is to general medicine: an inexact term for a vague but pernicious illness that is frustrating to treat, difficult to define, and impossible for the doctor to explain adequately to his patient.
 Demographic Borders
 Who are the borderline people one meets in everyday life?
 She is Carlotta, a friend since grade school. Over a minor slight, she accuses you of stabbing her in the back and tells you that you were really never her friend at all. Weeks or months later, Carlotta calls back, congenial and blasŽ, as if nothing had happened between you.
 He is Bob, a boss in your office. One day Bob bestows glowing praise for your efforts in a routine assignment; another day, he berates you for an insignificant error. At times he is reserved and distant; other times he is suddenly and uproariously ""one of the boys.""
 She is Arlene, your son&#39s girlfriend. One week, she is the picture of preppy; the next, she is the epitome of punk. She breaks up with your son one night, only to return hours later, pledging endless devotion.
 He is Brett, your next-door neighbor. Unable to come to grips with his collapsing marriage, he denies his wife&#39s obvious unfaithfulness in one breath, and then takes complete blame for it in the next. He clings desperately to his family, caroming from guilt and self-loathing to raging attacks on his wife and children who have so ""unfairly"" accused him.
 If the people in these short profiles seem inconsistent, it should not be surprising-inconsistency is the hallmark of BPD. Unable to tolerate paradox, those with borderline personality are walking paradoxes, human catch-22s. Their inconstancy is a major reason why the mental health profession has had such difficulty defining a uniform set of criteria for the illness.
 If these people seem all too familiar, this also should not be surprising. The chances are good that you have a spouse, relative, close friend, or coworker who has borderline personality. Perhaps you know a little bit about BPD or recognize borderline characteristics within yourself.
 Though it is difficult to get a firm grasp on the figures, mental health professionals generally agree that the number of borderline individuals in the general population is growing-and at a rapid pace-though some observers claim that it is the therapists&#39 awareness of the disorder that is growing rather than the number of borderline patients.
 Is borderline personality really a modern-day ""plague,"" or is merely the diagnostic label borderline new? In any event, the disorder has provided new insight into the psychological framework of several related conditions. Numerous studies have linked BPD with anorexia, bulimia, ADHD, drug addiction, and teenage suicide-all of which have increased alarmingly over the last decade. Some studies have uncovered BPD in almost 50 percent of all patients admitted to a facility for an eating disorder. Other studies have found that over 50 percent of substance abusers also fulfill criteria for BPD.
 Self-destructive tendencies or suicidal gestures are very common among borderline patients-indeed, they are one of the syndrome&#39s defining criteria. As many as 70 percent of BPD patients attempt suicide. The incidence of documented death by suicide is about 8 to 10 percent and even higher for borderline adolescents. A history of previous suicide attempts, a chaotic family life, and a lack of support systems increase the likelihood. The risk multiplies even more among borderline patients who also suffer from depressive or manic-depressive (bipolar) disorders, or from alcoholism or drug abuse.
 How Doctors Diagnose Psychiatric Disease
 Before 1980, DSM-I and II described psychiatric illnesses in descriptive terms. However, starting with DSM-III, psychiatric disorders have been defined along structured, categorical paradigms; that is, several symptoms have been proposed to be suggestive of a particular diagnosis, and when a certain number of these criteria are met, the individual is considered to fulfill the categorical requirements for diagnosis. Interestingly, in the four revisions of DSM since 1980, only minor adjustments have been made to the definitional criteria for BPD. As we shall see shortly, nine criteria are associated with BPD, and an individual qualifies for the diagnosis if he exhibits five or more of the nine.

Chapter One
 The World of Borderline Personality Disorder
 Everything looked and sounded unreal. Nothing was what it is. That&#39s what I wanted-to be alone with myself in another world where truth is untrue and life can hide from itself.
 -From Long Day&#39s Journey into Night, by Eugene O&#39Neill
 Dr. White thought it would all be relatively straightforward. Over the five years he had been treating Jennifer, she&#39d had few medical problems. Her stomach complaints were probably due to gastritis, he thought, so he treated her with antacids. But when her stomach pains became more intense despite treatment and routine testing proved normal, Dr. White admitted Jennifer to the hospital.
 After a thorough medical workup, Dr. White inquired about stresses Jennifer might be experiencing at work and home. She readily acknowledged that her job as a personnel manager for a major corporation was very pressured, but as she put it, ""Many people have pressure jobs."" She also revealed that her home life was more hectic recently. She was trying to cope with her husband&#39s busy legal practice while tending to the responsibilities of being a mother. But she doubted the connection of these factors to her stomach pains.
 When Dr. White recommended that Jennifer seek psychiatric consultation, she initially resisted. It was only after her discomfort turned into stabs of pain that she reluctantly agreed to see the psychiatrist Dr. Gray.
 They met a few days later. Appearing childlike and younger than her twenty-eight years, Jennifer lay in bed in a hospital room that had been transformed from an anonymous cubicle into a personalized lair. A stuffed animal sat next to her in bed, and another lay on the nightstand beside several pictures of her husband and son. Get-well cards were meticulously displayed in a line along the windowsill, flanked by flower arrangements.
 At first Jennifer was very formal, answering all of Dr. Gray&#39s questions with great seriousness. Then she joked about how her job was ""driving me to see a shrink."" The longer she talked, the sadder she looked. Her voice became less domineering and more childlike.
 She told him how a job promotion was exacting more demands-new responsibilities that were making her feel insecure. Her five-year-old son was starting school, which was proving to be a difficult separation for both of them. Conflicts with Allan, her husband, were increasing. She described rapid mood swings and trouble sleeping. Her appetite had steadily decreased and she was losing weight. Her concentration, energy, and sex drive had all diminished.
 Dr. Gray recommended a trial of antidepressant medications, which improved her gastric symptoms and seemed to normalize her sleeping patterns. In a few days she was ready for discharge and agreed to continue outpatient therapy.
 Over the following weeks, Jennifer talked more about her upbringing. Reared in a small town, she was the daughter of a prominent businessman and his socialite wife. Her father, an elder in the local church, demanded perfection from his daughter and her two older brothers, constantly reminding the children that the community was scrutinizing their behavior. Jennifer&#39s grades, her behavior, even her thoughts were never quite good enough. She feared her father, yet constantly-and unsuccessfully-sought his approval. Her mother remained passive and detached. Her parents evaluated her friends, often deeming them unacceptable. As a result, she had few friends and even fewer dates.
 Jennifer described her roller-coaster emotions, which seemed to have worsened when she started college. She began drinking for
the first time, sometimes to excess. Without warning, she would feel lonely and depressed and then high with happiness and love. On occasion, she would burst out in rage against her friends-fits of anger that she had somehow managed to suppress as a child.
 It was at about this time that she also began to appreciate the attention of men, something she had previously always avoided. Though she enjoyed being desired, she always felt she was ""fooling"" or tricking them somehow. After she began dating a man, she would sabotage the relationship by stirring up conflict.
 She met Allan as he was completing his law studies. He pursued her relentlessly and refused to be driven away when she tried to back off. He liked to choose her clothes and advise her on how to walk, how to talk, and how to eat nutritiously. He insisted she accompany him to the gym where he frequently worked out.
 ""Allan gave me an identity,"" she explained. He advised her on how to interact with his society partners and clients, when to be aggressive, when to be demure. She developed a cast of ""repertoire players""-characters or roles whom she could call to the stage on cue.
 They married, at Allan&#39s insistence, before the end of her junior year. She quit school and began working as a receptionist, but her employer recognized her intelligence and promoted her to more responsible jobs.
 At home, however, things began to sour. Allan&#39s career and his interest in bodybuilding caused him to spend more time away from home, which Jennifer hated. Sometimes she would start fights just to keep him home a little longer. Frequently, she would provoke him into hitting her. Afterward she would invite him to make love to her.
 Jennifer had few friends. She devalued women as gossipy and uninteresting. She hoped that her son Scott&#39s birth, coming two years after her marriage, would provide the comfort she lacked. She felt her son would always love her and always be there for her. But the demands of an infant were overwhelming, and after a while, Jennifer decided to return to work.
 Despite frequent praise and successes at work, Jennifer continued to feel insecure, that she was ""faking it."" She became sexually involved with a coworker who was almost forty years her senior.
 ""Usually I&#39m okay,"" she told Dr. Gray. ""But there&#39s another side that takes over and controls me. I&#39m a good mother. But my other side makes me a whore; it makes me act crazy!""
 Jennifer continued to deride herself, particularly when alone; during times of solitude, she would feel abandoned, which she attributed to her own unworthiness. Anxiety would threaten to overwhelm her unless she found some kind of release. Sometimes she&#39d indulge in eating binges, once consuming an entire bowl of cookie batter. She would spend long hours gazing at pictures of her son and husband, trying to ""keep them alive in my brain.""
 Jennifer&#39s physical appearance at her therapy sessions fluctuated dramatically. When coming directly from work, she would dress in a business suit that exuded maturity and sophistication. But on her days off, she showed up in short pants and knee socks, with her hair in braids; at these appointments she acted like a little girl with a high-pitched voice and used a more limited vocabulary.
 Sometimes she would transform right before Dr. Gray&#39s eyes. She could be insightful and intelligent, working collaboratively toward greater self-understanding, and then become a child, coquettish and seductive, pronouncing herself incapable of functioning in the adult world. She could be charming and ingratiating or manipulative and hostile. She could storm out of one session, vowing never to return, and at the next session cower with the fear that Dr. Gray would refuse to see her again.
 Jennifer felt like a child clad in the armor of an adult. She was perplexed at the respect she received from other adults; she expected them to see through her disguise at any moment, revealing her to be an empress with no clothes. She needed someone to love and protect her from the world. She desperately sought closeness, but when someone came too close, she ran.
  Jennifer is afflicted with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). She is not alone. Studies estimate that as many as 19 million or more Americans (3 to 6 percent of the population) exhibit primary symptoms of BPD, and many studies suggest this figure is an underestimation. Approximately 10 percent of psychiatric outpatients and 20 percent of inpatients, and between 15 and 25 percent of all patients seeking psychiatric care, are diagnosed with the disorder. It is one of the most common of all of the personality disorders.
 Yet, despite its prevalence, BPD remains relatively unknown to the general public. Ask the man on the street about anxiety, depression, or alcoholism, and he would probably be able to provide a sketchy, if not technically accurate, description of the illness. Ask him to define Borderline Personality Disorder, and he would probably give you a blank stare. Ask an experienced mental health clinician about the disorder, on the other hand, and you will get a much different response. She will sigh deeply and exclaim that of all her psychiatric patients, borderline patients are the most difficult, the most dreaded, and the most to be avoided-more than those with schizophrenia, more than those suffering from alcoholism or substance abuse, more than any other patient. For decades BPD has been lurking as a kind of ""Third World"" of mental illness-indistinct, massive, and vaguely threatening.
 BPD has been underrecognized partly because the diagnosis is still relatively new. For years, ""borderline"" was used as a catchall category for patients who did not fit more established diagnoses. People described as borderline seemed more ill than neurotic patients (who experience severe anxiety secondary to emotional conflict), yet less ill than psychotic patients (whose detachment from reality makes normal functioning impossible).
 The disorder also coexists with, and borders on, other mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, schizophrenia, somatization disorder (hypochondriasis), dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcoholism, drug abuse (including nicotine dependence), eating disorders, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, hysteria, sociopathy, and other personality disorders.

 Self-destructive tendencies or suicidal gestures are very common among borderline patients-indeed, they are one of the syndrome&#39s defining criteria. As many as 70 percent of BPD patients attempt suicide. The incidence of documented death by suicide is about 8 to 10 percent and even higher for borderline adolescents. A history of previous suicide attempts, a chaotic family life, and a lack of support systems increase the likelihood. The risk multiplies even more among borderline patients who also suffer from depressive or manic-depressive (bipolar) disorders, or from alcoholism or drug abuse.
 How Doctors Diagnose Psychiatric Disease
 Before 1980, DSM-I and II described psychiatric illnesses in descriptive terms. However, starting with DSM-III, psychiatric disorders have been defined along structured, categorical paradigms; that is, several symptoms have been proposed to be suggestive of a particular diagnosis, and when a certain number of these criteria are met, the individual is considered to fulfill the categorical requirements for diagnosis. Interestingly, in the four revisions of DSM since 1980, only minor adjustments have been made to the definitional criteria for BPD. As we shall see shortly, nine criteria are associated with BPD, and an individual qualifies for the diagnosis if he exhibits five or more of the nine.

Chapter One
 The World of Borderline Personality Disorder
 Everything looked and sounded unreal. Nothing was what it is. That&#39s what I wanted-to be alone with myself in another world where truth is untrue and life can hide from itself.
 -From Long Day&#39s Journey into Night, by Eugene O&#39Neill
 Dr. White thought it would all be relatively straightforward. Over the five years he had been treating Jennifer, she&#39d had few medical problems. Her stomach complaints were probably due to gastritis, he thought, so he treated her with antacids. But when her stomach pains became more intense despite treatment and routine testing proved normal, Dr. White admitted Jennifer to the hospital.
 After a thorough medical workup, Dr. White inquired about stresses Jennifer might be experiencing at work and home. She readily acknowledged that her job as a personnel manager for a major corporation was very pressured, but as she put it, ""Many people have pressure jobs."" She also revealed that her home life was more hectic recently. She was trying to cope with her husband&#39s busy legal practice while tending to the responsibilities of being a mother. But she doubted the connection of these factors to her stomach pains.
 When Dr. White recommended that Jennifer seek psychiatric consultation, she initially resisted. It was only after her discomfort turned into stabs of pain that she reluctantly agreed to see the psychiatrist Dr. Gray.
 They met a few days later. Appearing childlike and younger than her twenty-eight years, Jennifer lay in bed in a hospital room that had been transformed from an anonymous cubicle into a personalized lair. A stuffed animal sat next to her in bed, and another lay on the nightstand beside several pictures of her husband and son. Get-well cards were meticulously displayed in a line along the windowsill, flanked by flower arrangements.
 At first Jennifer was very formal, answering all of Dr. Gray&#39s questions with great seriousness. Then she joked about how her job was ""driving me to see a shrink."" The longer she talked, the sadder she looked. Her voice became less domineering and more childlike.
 She told him how a job promotion was exacting more demands-new responsibilities that were making her feel insecure. Her five-year-old son was starting school, which was proving to be a difficult separation for both of them. Conflicts with Allan, her husband, were increasing. She described rapid mood swings and trouble sleeping. Her appetite had steadily decreased and she was losing weight. Her concentration, energy, and sex drive had all diminished.
 Dr. Gray recommended a trial of antidepressant medications, which improved her gastric symptoms and seemed to normalize her sleeping patterns. In a few days she was ready for discharge and agreed to continue outpatient therapy.
 Over the following weeks, Jennifer talked more about her upbringing. Reared in a small town, she was the daughter of a prominent businessman and his socialite wife. Her father, an elder in the local church, demanded perfection from his daughter and her two older brothers, constantly reminding the children that the community was scrutinizing their behavior. Jennifer&#39s grades, her behavior, even her thoughts were never quite good enough. She feared her father, yet constantly-and unsuccessfully-sought his approval. Her mother remained passive and detached. Her parents evaluated her friends, often deeming them unacceptable. As a result, she had few friends and even fewer dates.
 Jennifer described her roller-coaster emotions, which seemed to have worsened when she started college. She began drinking for
the first time, sometimes to excess. Without warning, she would feel lonely and depressed and then high with happiness and love. On occasion, she would burst out in rage against her friends-fits of anger that she had somehow managed to suppress as a child.
 It was at about this time that she also began to appreciate the attention of men, something she had previously always avoided. Though she enjoyed being desired, she always felt she was ""fooling"" or tricking them somehow. After she began dating a man, she would sabotage the relationship by stirring up conflict.
 She met Allan as he was completing his law studies. He pursued her relentlessly and refused to be driven away when she tried to back off. He liked to choose her clothes and advise her on how to walk, how to talk, and how to eat nutritiously. He insisted she accompany him to the gym where he frequently worked out.
 ""Allan gave me an identity,"" she explained. He advised her on how to interact with his society partners and clients, when to be aggressive, when to be demure. She developed a cast of ""repertoire players""-characters or roles whom she could call to the stage on cue.
 They married, at Allan&#39s insistence, before the end of her junior year. She quit school and began working as a receptionist, but her employer recognized her intelligence and promoted her to more responsible jobs.
 At home, however, things began to sour. Allan&#39s career and his interest in bodybuilding caused him to spend more time away from home, which Jennifer hated. Sometimes she would start fights just to keep him home a little longer. Frequently, she would provoke him into hitting her. Afterward she would invite him to make love to her.
 Jennifer had few friends. She devalued women as gossipy and uninteresting. She hoped that her son Scott&#39s birth, coming two years after her marriage, would provide the comfort she lacked. She felt her son would always love her and always be there for her. But the demands of an infant were overwhelming, and after a while, Jennifer decided to return to work.
 Despite frequent praise and successes at work, Jennifer continued to feel insecure, that she was ""faking it."" She became sexually involved with a coworker who was almost forty years her senior.
 ""Usually I&#39m okay,"" she told Dr. Gray. ""But there&#39s another side that takes over and controls me. I&#39m a good mother. But my other side makes me a whore; it makes me act crazy!""
 Jennifer continued to deride herself, particularly when alone; during times of solitude, she would feel abandoned, which she attributed to her own unworthiness. Anxiety would threaten to overwhelm her unless she found some kind of release. Sometimes she&#39d indulge in eating binges, once consuming an entire bowl of cookie batter. She would spend long hours gazing at pictures of her son and husband, trying to ""keep them alive in my brain.""
 Jennifer&#39s physical appearance at her therapy sessions fluctuated dramatically. When coming directly from work, she would dress in a business suit that exuded maturity and sophistication. But on her days off, she showed up in short pants and knee socks, with her hair in braids; at these appointments she acted like a little girl with a high-pitched voice and used a more limited vocabulary.
 Sometimes she would transform right before Dr. Gray&#39s eyes. She could be insightful and intelligent, working collaboratively toward greater self-understanding, and then become a child, coquettish and seductive, pronouncing herself incapable of functioning in the adult world. She could be charming and ingratiating or manipulative and hostile. She could storm out of one session, vowing never to return, and at the next session cower with the fear that Dr. Gray would refuse to see her again.
 Jennifer felt like a child clad in the armor of an adult. She was perplexed at the respect she received from other adults; she expected them to see through her disguise at any moment, revealing her to be an empress with no clothes. She needed someone to love and protect her from the world. She desperately sought closeness, but when someone came too close, she ran.
  Jennifer is afflicted with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). She is not alone. Studies estimate that as many as 19 million or more Americans (3 to 6 percent of the population) exhibit primary symptoms of BPD, and many studies suggest this figure is an underestimation. Approximately 10 percent of psychiatric outpatients and 20 percent of inpatients, and between 15 and 25 percent of all patients seeking psychiatric care, are diagnosed with the disorder. It is one of the most common of all of the personality disorders.
 Yet, despite its prevalence, BPD remains relatively unknown to the general public. Ask the man on the street about anxiety, depression, or alcoholism, and he would probably be able to provide a sketchy, if not technically accurate, description of the illness. Ask him to define Borderline Personality Disorder, and he would probably give you a blank stare. Ask an experienced mental health clinician about the disorder, on the other hand, and you will get a much different response. She will sigh deeply and exclaim that of all her psychiatric patients, borderline patients are the most difficult, the most dreaded, and the most to be avoided-more than those with schizophrenia, more than those suffering from alcoholism or substance abuse, more than any other patient. For decades BPD has been lurking as a kind of ""Third World"" of mental illness-indistinct, massive, and vaguely threatening.
 BPD has been underrecognized partly because the diagnosis is still relatively new. For years, ""borderline"" was used as a catchall category for patients who did not fit more established diagnoses. People described as borderline seemed more ill than neurotic patients (who experience severe anxiety secondary to emotional conflict), yet less ill than psychotic patients (whose detachment from reality makes normal functioning impossible).
 The disorder also coexists with, and borders on, other mental illnesses: depression, anxiety, bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder, schizophrenia, somatization disorder (hypochondriasis), dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcoholism, drug abuse (including nicotine dependence), eating disorders, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder, hysteria, sociopathy, and other personality disorders.
 Though the term borderline was first coined in the 1930s, the condition was not clearly defined until the 1970s. For years, psychiatrists could not seem to agree on the separate existence of the syndrome, much less on the specific symptoms necessary for diagnosis. But as more and more people began to seek therapy for a unique set of life problems, the parameters of the disorder crystallized. In 1980, the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder was first defined in the American Psychiatric Association&#39s third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), the diagnostic ""bible"" of the psychiatric profession. Since then, several revisions of the DSM have been produced, the most recent being DSM-5, published in 2013. Though various schools within psychiatry still quarrel over the exact nature, causes, and treatment of BPD, the disorder is officially recognized as a major mental health problem in America today. Indeed, BPD patients consume a greater percentage of mental health services than those with just about any other diagnosis. Additionally, studies corroborate that about 90 percent of patients with the BPD diagnosis also share at least one other major psychiatric diagnosis.BPD is also often connected to significant medical diseases, especially in women. These include chronic headaches and other pain, arthritis, and diseases of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urinary, pulmonary, hepatic, immune, and oncological systems.In 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives designated May as Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month. And yet, unfortunately, current government-sponsored research on BPD represents only a fraction of the work directed to less common disorders, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.
 In many ways, the borderline syndrome has been to psychiatry what a virus is to general medicine: an inexact term for a vague but pernicious illness that is frustrating to treat, difficult to define, and impossible for the doctor to explain adequately to his patient.
 Demographic Borders
 Who are the borderline people one meets in everyday life?
 She is Carlotta, a friend since grade school. Over a minor slight, she accuses you of stabbing her in the back and tells you that you were really never her friend at all. Weeks or months later, Carlotta calls back, congenial and blasŽ, as if nothing had happened between you.
 He is Bob, a boss in your office. One day Bob bestows glowing praise for your efforts in a routine assignment; another day, he berates you for an insignificant error. At times he is reserved and distant; other times he is suddenly and uproariously ""one of the boys.""
 She is Arlene, your son&#39s girlfriend. One week, she is the picture of preppy; the next, she is the epitome of punk. She breaks up with your son one night, only to return hours later, pledging endless devotion.
 He is Brett, your next-door neighbor. Unable to come to grips with his collapsing marriage, he denies his wife&#39s obvious unfaithfulness in one breath, and then takes complete blame for it in the next. He clings desperately to his family, caroming from guilt and self-loathing to raging attacks on his wife and children who have so ""unfairly"" accused him.
 If the people in these short profiles seem inconsistent, it should not be surprising-inconsistency is the hallmark of BPD. Unable to tolerate paradox, those with borderline personality are walking paradoxes, human catch-22s. Their inconstancy is a major reason why the mental health profession has had such difficulty defining a uniform set of criteria for the illness.
 If these people seem all too familiar, this also should not be surprising. The chances are good that you have a spouse, relative, close friend, or coworker who has borderline personality. Perhaps you know a little bit about BPD or recognize borderline characteristics within yourself.
 Though it is difficult to get a firm grasp on the figures, mental health professionals generally agree that the number of borderline individuals in the general population is growing-and at a rapid pace-though some observers claim that it is the therapists&#39 awareness of the disorder that is growing rather than the number of borderline patients.
 Is borderline personality really a modern-day ""plague,"" or is merely the diagnostic label borderline new? In any event, the disorder has provided new insight into the psychological framework of several related conditions. Numerous studies have linked BPD with anorexia, bulimia, ADHD, drug addiction, and teenage suicide-all of which have increased alarmingly over the last decade. Some studies have uncovered BPD in almost 50 percent of all patients admitted to a facility for an eating disorder. Other studies have found that over 50 percent of substance abusers also fulfill criteria for BPD.
 Self-destructive tendencies or suicidal gestures are very common among borderline patients-indeed, they are one of the syndrome&#39s defining criteria. As many as 70 percent of BPD patients attempt suicide. The incidence of documented death by suicide is about 8 to 10 percent and even higher for borderline adolescents. A history of previous suicide attempts, a chaotic family life, and a lack of support systems increase the likelihood. The risk multiplies even more among borderline patients who also suffer from depressive or manic-depressive (bipolar) disorders, or from alcoholism or drug abuse.

As we shall see shortly, nine criteria are associated with BPD, and an individual qualifies for the diagnosis if he exhibits five or more of the nine.

Reasons to Stay Alive is Matt&#39s inspiring account of how, minute by minute and day by day, he overcame the disease with the help of reading, writing, and the love of his parents and his girlfriend (and now-wife), Andrea.

Everyone&#39s lives are touched by mental illness: if we do not suffer from it ourselves, then we have a friend or loved one who does.
