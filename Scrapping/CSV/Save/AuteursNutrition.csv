Le Dr Natasha Campbell-Mc Bride a fondé la clinique de nutrition de Cambridge (Cambridge Nutrition Clinic) en 1998. En tant que parent d'un enfant ayant souffert de sévères troubles de l'apprentissage, elle était particulièrement consciente des difficultés rencontrées par d'autres parents d'enfants en difficulté et a consacré le plus clair de son temps à aider ces familles. Elle s'est aperçue que la nutrition pouvait apporter une aide essentielle aux enfants et aux adultes luttant contre ces troubles ; elle a été la première à utiliser des probiotiques dans ce domaine.

Désireuse de partager ses connaissances, elle a publié de nombreux écrits et donné plusieurs séries de conférences et de séminaires ayant pour thème les troubles de l'apprentissage et les troubles digestifs. Cet ouvrage rend compte des connaissances qu'elle a acquises par l'expérience ainsi que de ses travaux les plus récents.

Le Dr Natasha Campbell-Mc Bride pense qu’il y a un lien tout à fait certain entre notre santé physique et mentale, entre notre façon de manger et l’état de notre système digestif ; les résultats de ses travaux ont confirmé ce point. Dans sa clinique, les parents abordent avec elle tous les aspects des troubles et des symptômes de leur enfant, mis en confiance par le fait qu’ils s’adressent non seulement à un médecin, mais aussi à une mère ayant vécu une expérience semblable à la leur. Son propre apprentissage sur le plan personnel rend d’autant plus précieux ses conseils et son accompagnement au combat quotidien que ces familles ont à mener.

Chris van Tulleken,"Revue de presse
You’ve got to get this book in your life . . . Completely compelling . . . Read a page and think about it for the rest of the week -- Chris Evans

A devastating, witty and scholarly destruction of the shit food we eat and why -- Adam Rutherford

If you only read one diet or nutrition book in your life, make it this one. It will not only change the way you eat but the way you think about food. And it does all this without a hint of finger-wagging or body shaming. I came away feeling so much better informed about every aspect of ultra-processed food, from the way it affects the microbes in our gut to why it is so profitable to produce to why it's so hard to eat only a single bowl of Coco Pops to why any food that is marketed as 'better for you' is almost certainly not. -- Bee Wilson

A wonderful and fascinating exposé of ultra-processed food, edible substances with strange sounding ingredients which are manufactured by some of the wealthiest companies on the planet and which, worryingly, form an increasing part of our diet. As Chris shows, not only have these foods been formulated to ensure that we eat them constantly and without thought, but they hijack our ability to regulate what we eat, primarily by affecting our brains. And he backs up his claims with a powerful self-experiment, along with lots of rigorous and often shocking research. Reading this book will make you question what you eat and how it was produced -- Dr. Michael Mosley ― BBC presenter and bestselling author of The Fast Diet

Packed with ""I never knew that"" moments, Ultra-Processed People is a wonderfully playful book that changed forever how I think about what I eat and why -- Hannah Fry

'If you only read one diet or nutrition book in your life, make it this one' Bee Wilson

'A devastating, witty and scholarly destruction of the shit food we eat and why' Adam Rutherford

---

An eye-opening investigation into the science, economics, history and production of ultra-processed food.

It's not you, it's the food.

We have entered a new 'age of eating' where most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food, food which is industrially processed and designed and marketed to be addictive. But do we really know what it's doing to our bodies?

Join Chris in his travels through the world of food science and a UPF diet to discover what's really going on. Find out why exercise and willpower can't save us, and what UPF is really doing to our bodies, our health, our weight, and the planet (hint: nothing good).

For too long we've been told we just need to make different choices, when really we're living in a food environment that makes it nigh-on impossible. So this is a book about our rights. The right to know what we eat and what it does to our bodies and the right to good, affordable food.

Health Food or Health Disaster?

The greatest obstacle to discovering the shape of the earth, the continents, and the ocean was not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge.  —Daniel J. Boorstin, The Discoverers, 1985

Actor Liam Hemsworth publicly blamed spinach smoothies for a 2019 kidney stone episode that required surgery. At age 29 he had to miss a movie premiere and an awards banquet because of it. In 2020, Men’s Health magazine quoted Mr. Hemsworth as saying: “February last year, I was feeling really low and lethargic and wasn’t feeling good generally. And then I got a kidney stone.” He added: “Every morning I was having five handfuls of spinach and then almond milk, almond butter, and also some vegan protein in a smoothie. And that was what I considered super healthy. So, I had to completely rethink what I was putting into my body.”

This book invites you to do just that: Rethink your “health” food.

Even moderate, relatively common levels of oxalate in a habitual diet can fuel the customary aches and pains of life: digestive distress, inflamed joints, chronic skin issues, brain fog or mood problems, as well as health declines associated with “normal” aging. And then there are those painful kidney stones. Eighty percent of them are formed from oxalate, much of which comes from the foods we eat.

Mr. Hemsworth was one of the lucky ones. Three weeks after completing a 10-day “green smoothie cleanse” for weight loss, a New York City woman with a history of gastric bypass surgery went to the Nassau University Medical Center on Long Island, complaining of persistent nausea, weakness, and poor appetite. She was immediately put on a low-oxalate diet, but it was too late, her kidneys did not recover, and she remained dialysis-dependent.

Similar examples of kidney failure due to consumption of “health foods” include a man, also attempting to lose weight, who juiced celery, carrots, parsley, beets with their greens, and spinach. The man’s kidneys were seriously damaged. His doctors at the Mayo Clinic prescribed dialysis and a low-oxalate diet. He stopped juicing. It took more than four months for his kidney function to improve.

And it’s not just kidney failure. Damage from dietary oxalate can hit any—or every—bodily system and cause serious chronic health problems. It’s no accident that Mr. Hemsworth’s kidney stones were preceded by malaise, depression, and lethargy. However, most medical journals reporting health crises from overzealous oxalate consumption fail to mention the non-kidney problems that likely also occurred.

Because it is so easy to overeat oxalates, chances are you may already be experiencing occasional oxalate-related aches and pains somewhere in your body. Do you tend to get a stiff neck? In those of us with dietary oxalate overload, pain, knots, or stiffness in the top of the shoulders or in the upper or lower back are typical. Some people experience chronic or intermittent joint inflammation, gout, arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, or a more generalized stiffness, often accompanied by a lack of pep.

Or perhaps you have long-standing injuries or chronic itching, tingling, or pain that never fully resolves. Your doctors can’t help you figure out what is going on; they seem to think you’re “just fine” and should just live with life’s little miseries. If any of this rings true for you—if you don’t feel “just fine”—this book may be your golden opportunity to turn things around.

Other seemingly small things can be indicators of oxalate overload, including itchy or dry eyes, eye floaters, excessive tartar on the teeth, tooth sensitivity, sensitive or frail skin, and odd things like pressure or pain in the loins, irritable bladder, urinary tract infections, frequent urination, or cloudy urine. Liver stress from oxalate overload can aggravate chemical sensitivity. Digestive problems like indigestion, reflux, bloating, excessive belching, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome are especially common. Additional symptoms can include shortness of breath, sinus problems, yeast infections, and even cold hands and feet.

Do you ever feel especially clumsy or occasionally have poor coordination? Do you get muscle spasms or eye twitches, or have memory or word-finding difficulties, headaches, or anxiety and panic disorder? Being neurotoxic, oxalates can get in—and on—your nerves. Oxalic acid chemically bonds to calcium and other minerals and interferes with cell energy production. Relentless oxalate consumption can cause oxalate to build up inside the body without obvious symptoms and may culminate years later as “old-age problems” such as bad bones, chronic pain, and vision and hearing loss. Oxalate deposits are also associated with brain cell damage that leads to Parkinson’s disease and dementia disorders.

You don’t have to have symptoms to have a disease, and oxalate toxicity is no exception. But a wide spectrum of potential symptoms can occur in the wake of oxalate overload, and each of us will (eventually) suffer from our own unique subset of them if we persist with high-oxalate eating. To make it easier to consider your own situation, you can take the Risks, Symptoms, and Exposure Self-Quiz (in the Resources section, page 275) or look over Table 10.1, which lists body systems and oxalate-associated symptoms. Keep reading to get the interesting details.

There are several factors that increase the likelihood that your high-oxalate diet may be leading to oxalate overload and symptoms, including:

•A diet low in calcium and other minerals (dairy-free and vegan diets are two examples)

•Frequent use of gut-irritating foods, including beans, bran, whole grains, quinoa

•A history of repeated use of antibiotic or antifungal medications

•Long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medications (NSAIDs)

•Obesity or diabetes

•Crohn’s disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), leaky gut, food sensitivities, bariatric surgery, or gut dysbiosis

•Frailty or other chronic non-oxalate illness

•Poor kidney health, history of kidney stones, family history of kidney disease.

As you will see in Part 2 of the book, simply trying a low-oxalate diet for a few months is another way to assess your situation.

The Hard Road to Enlightenment

Maybe, like me, you have always considered yourself a healthy eater. It was healthy eating that led to my ill health. I was beyond exhausted—unable to read with comprehension, unable to work. A high-tech sleep study showed that I was waking up 29 times every hour. Medications did nothing to improve the situation. I was stuck, and no one could help me. I had problems with joint pain and symptoms of genital burning, but I did not connect them to my exhaustion and sleep issues. It was my genital burning that, in 2009, led me to the Vulvar Pain (VP) Foundation, and under the fog of my heavy brain fatigue I decided to try the low-oxalate diet they recommended, hoping for relief from genital pain, not understanding the potential scope of effects or the long period needed for full recovery from oxalate damage.

In my ignorance, I drifted back to my beloved sweet potatoes and celery, and in 2013, I added kiwifruit to my diet in a desperate attempt to resolve my chronic constipation. After three months of a daily kiwi (sometimes two), my arthritis and stiffness became severe (all over again). This led to the brain-twisting recognition that dietary oxalate was related to my decades of joint pain. Grudgingly, I finally got serious about maintaining a low-oxalate diet.

Once I consistently shunned my go-to high-oxalate foods (for me, mainly sweet potatoes and chard), multiple personal miracles unfolded. The debilitating sleep disorder vanished, decades of pain and joint problems receded, and I started to feel younger. I never imagined anything like that was possible. The contrast between the years of intractable problems and then dramatic, lasting, and wholly unexpected benefits in the wake of the diet change was eye-opening.
Revue de presse
“Who knew that some so-called superfoods could be the opposite of healthy? The conventional advice to eat ‘mostly plants’ is seriously challenged by the reality that plants contain known toxins. Norton makes a compelling case that oxalates are the x-factor contributing to many mysterious health conditions.”—Nina Teicholz, author of The Big Fat Surprise

“What if your favorite superfood was actually a supervillain? Sally Norton masterfully pinpoints the changes in our food system and eating style that have turned a common natural occurring toxin into a potential public health crisis for people who are trying their best to eat well. Her simple and effective recommendations are grounded both in modern science and the principles of ancestral health.”—Aaron Blaisdell, PhD, UCLA Professor of Behavioral Neuroscience

“As a medical profession, we have only recently begun to realize how commonly we are seeing oxalate issues be a part of the presentation of a wide variety of chronic illnesses. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been wrestling with poor health and not gotten the answers they need.”—Neil Nathan, MD, author of Toxic
