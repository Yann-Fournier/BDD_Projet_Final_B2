Ray Dalio,"From the international bestselling author of Principles and legendary investor Ray Dalio, who has spent half a century studying global markets, The Changing World Order examines history’s most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we’ve experienced in our lifetimes.

A few years ago, renowned investor Ray Dalio began noticing a confluence of political and economic conditions he hadn’t encountered before in his fifty-year career. They included large debts and zero or near-zero interest rates in the world’s three major reserve currencies; significant wealth, political and values divisions within countries; and emerging conflict between a rising world power (China) and the existing one (US).

Seeking to explain the cause-effect relationships behind these conditions, he began a study of analogous historical times and discovered that such combinations of conditions were characteristic of periods of transition, such as the years between 1930 and 1945, in which wealth and power shifted in ways that reshaped the world order. Looking back across five hundred years of history and nine major empires - including the Dutch, the British and the American - The Changing World Order puts into perspective the cycles and forces that have driven the successes and failures of all the world’s major countries throughout history.

Dalioreveals the timeless and universal dynamics that were behind these shifts, while also offering practical principles for policymakers, business leaders, investors and others operating in this environment.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/amzn-author-media-prod/fp68pggfjoku3k5iq1ndhm39hg._SY600_.jpg

We live under an ideology that preys on every aspect of our lives: our education and our jobs; our healthcare and our leisure; our relationships and our mental wellbeing; even the planet we inhabit – the very air we breathe. So pervasive has it become that, for most people, it has no name. It seems unavoidable, like a natural law.

But trace it back to its roots, and we discover that it is neither inevitable nor immutable. It was conceived, propagated, and then concealed by the powerful few. It is time t

Gregory Zuckerman,"Extrait
Introduction

You do know— no one will speak with you, right?”
I was picking at a salad at a fish restaurant in Cambridge, Massa­chusetts, in early September 2017, trying my best to get a British mathematician named Nick Patterson to open up about his former company, Renaissance Technologies. I wasn’t having much luck.
I told Patterson that I wanted to write a book about how James Simons, Renaissance’s founder, had created the greatest moneymaking machine in financial history. Renaissance generated so much wealth that Simons and his colleagues had begun to wield enormous influence in the worlds of politics, science, education, and philanthropy. Anticipating dramatic societal shifts, Simons harnessed algorithms, computer models, and big data before Mark Zuckerberg and his peers had a chance to finish nursery school.
Patterson wasn’t very encouraging. By then, Simons and his representa­tives had told me they weren’t going to provide much help, either. Renais­sance executives and others close to Simons—even those I once considered friends—wouldn’t return my calls or emails. Even archrivals begged out of meetings at Simons’s request, as if he was a Mafia boss they dared not offend.
Over and over, I was reminded of the iron-clad, thirty-page nondisclo­sure agreements the firm forced employees to sign, preventing even retirees from divulging much. I got it, guys. But come on. I’d been at the Wall Street Journal for a couple of decades; I knew how the game was played. Subjects, even recalcitrant ones, usually come around. After all, who doesn’t want a book written about them? Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies, ap­parently.
I wasn’t entirely shocked. Simons and his team are among the most se­cretive traders Wall Street has encountered, loath to drop even a hint of how they’d conquered financial markets, lest a competitor seize on any clue. Em­ployees avoid media appearances and steer clear of industry conferences and most public gatherings. Simons once quoted Benjamin, the donkey in Ani­mal Farm, to explain his attitude: “ ‘God gave me a tail to keep off the flies. But I’d rather have had no tail and no flies.’ That’s kind of the way I feel about publicity.”
I looked up from my meal and forced a smile.
This is going to be a battle.
I kept at it, probing defenses, looking for openings. Writing about Si­mons and learning his secrets became my fixation. The obstacles he put up only added allure to the chase.
There were compelling reasons I was determined to tell Simons’s story. A former math professor, Simons is arguably the most successful trader in the history of modern finance. Since 1988, Renaissance’s flagship Medallion hedge fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent, racking up trading profits of more than $100 billion (see Appendix 1 for how I arrive at these numbers). No one in the investment world comes close. Warren Buf­fett, George Soros, Peter Lynch, Steve Cohen, and Ray Dalio all fall short (see Appendix 2).
In recent years, Renaissance has been scoring over $7 billion annually in trading gains. That’s more than the annual revenues of brand- name cor­porations including Under Armour, Levi Strauss, Hasbro, and Hyatt Hotels. Here’s the absurd thing— while those other companies have tens of thou­sands of employees, there are just three hundred or so at Renaissance.
I’ve determined that Simons is worth about $23 billion, making him wealthier than Elon Musk of Tesla Motors, Rupert Murdoch of News Corp, and Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs’s widow. Others at the firm are also billionaires. The average Renaissance employee has nearly $50 million just in the firm’s own hedge funds. Simons and his team truly create wealth in the manner of fairy tales full of kings, straw, and lots and lots of gold.
More than the trading successes intrigued me. Early on, Simons made a decision to dig through mountains of data, employ advanced mathematics, and develop cutting- edge computer models, while others were still relying on intuition, instinct, and old- fashioned research for their own predictions. Simons inspired a revolution that has since swept the investing world. By early 2019, hedge funds and other quantitative, or quant, investors had emerged as the market’s largest players, controlling about 30 percent of stock trading, topping the activity of both individual investors and traditional investing firms.2 MBAs once scoffed at the thought of relying on a scientific and systematic approach to investing, confident they could hire coders if they were ever needed. Today, coders say the same about MBAs, if they think about them at all.
Simons’s pioneering methods have been embraced in almost every in­dustry, and reach nearly every corner of everyday life. He and his team were crunching statistics, turning tasks over to machines, and relying on algo­rithms more than three decades ago— long before these tactics were em­braced in Silicon Valley, the halls of government, sports stadiums, doctors’ offices, military command centers, and pretty much everywhere else fore­casting is required.
Simons developed strategies to corral and manage talent, turning raw brainpower and mathematical aptitude into astonishing wealth. He made money from math, and a lot of money, at that. A few decades ago, it wasn’t remotely possible.
Lately, Simons has emerged as a modern- day Medici, subsidizing the salaries of thousands of public- school math and science teachers, working to cure autism and expand our understanding of the origins of life. His efforts, while valuable, raise the question of whether one individual should enjoy so much influence. So, too, does the clout of his senior executive, Robert Mercer, who is perhaps the individual most responsible for Donald Trump’s presidential victory in 2016. Mercer, Trump’s biggest financial supporter, plucked Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway from obscurity and inserted them into the Trump campaign, stabilizing it during a difficult period. Companies formerly owned by Mercer and now in the hands of his daughter Rebekah played key roles in the successful campaign to encourage the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Simons, Mercer, and others at Renaissance will continue to have broad impact for years to come.
The successes of Simons and his team prompt a number of challenging questions. What does it say about financial markets that mathematicians and scientists are better at predicting their direction than veteran investors at the largest traditional firms? Do Simons and his colleagues enjoy a fun­damental understanding of investing that eludes the rest of us? Do Simons’s achievements prove human judgment and intuition are inherently flawed, and that only models and automated systems can handle the deluge of data that seems to overwhelm us? Do the triumph and popularity of Simons’s quantitative methods create new, overlooked risks?
I was most fascinated by a striking paradox: Simons and his team shouldn’t have been the ones to master the market. Simons never took a single finance class, didn’t care very much for business, and, until he turned forty, only dabbled in trading. A decade later, he still hadn’t made much headway.
 Heck, Simons didn’t even do applied mathematics, he did theoretical math, the most impractical kind. His firm, located in a sleepy town on the North Shore of Long Island, hires mathematicians and scientists who don’t know anything about investing or the ways of Wall Street. Some are even outright suspicious of capitalism. Yet, Simons and his colleagues are the ones who changed the way investors approach financial markets, leaving an industry of traders, investors, and other pros in the dust. It’s as if a group of tourists, on their first trip to South America, with a few odd- looking tools and mea­ger provisions, discovered El Dorado and proceeded to plunder the golden city, as hardened explorers looked on in frustration.
Finally, I hit my own pay dirt. I learned about Simons’s early life, his tenure as a groundbreaking mathematician and Cold War code- breaker, and the volatile early period of his firm. Contacts shared details about Renais­sance’s most important breakthroughs as well as recent events featuring more drama and intrigue than I had imagined. Eventually, I conducted more than four hundred interviews with more than thirty current and former Renaissance employees. I spoke with an even larger number of Simons’s friends, family members, and others who participated in, or were familiar with, the events I describe. I owe deep gratitude to each individual who spent time sharing memories, observations, and insights. Some accepted substan­tial personal risk to help me tell this story. I hope I rewarded their faith.
Even Simons spoke with me, eventually. He asked me not to write this book and never truly warmed to the project. But Simons was gracious enough to spend more than ten hours discussing certain periods of his life, while refusing to discuss Renaissance’s trading and most other activities. His thoughts were valuable and appreciated.
This book is a work of nonfiction. It is based on first- person accounts and recollections of those who witnessed or were aware of the events I depict. I understand that memories fade, so I’ve done my best to check and confirm every fact, incident, and quote.
I’ve tried to tell Simons’s story in a way that will appeal to the general reader as well as to professionals in quantitative finance and mathematics. I will refer to hidden Markov models, kernel methods of machine learning, and stochastic differential equations, but there also will be broken marriages, corporate intrigue, and panicked traders.
For all his insights and prescience, Simons was blindsided by much that took place in his life. That may be the most enduring lesson of his remarkable story.

Joel Mokyr,"À la fin du XVIIIᵉ siècle, une floraison d'inventions techniques a donné naissance à la Révolution industrielle et à la croissance économique régulière dont est issue la prospérité sans précédent d'aujourd'hui. Or, si le déroulement de cet épisode capital est désormais bien connu, ses origines demeurent mystérieuses. Pourquoi la Révolution industrielle s'est-elle produite en Occident et pas ailleurs ? La thèse de Joel Mokyr est qu'elle a été rendue possible par une culture de la croissance propre à l'Europe moderne et consacrée par les Lumières européennes. Les bases en ont été jetées dans la période 1500-1700, qui a vu les premières avancées scientifiques et techniques destinées à nourrir les développements explosifs de la suite. Elle a été favorisée par la fragmentation politique de l'Europe. Celle-ci a créé les conditions d'un ""marché des idées"" fonctionnant autour de la République des Lettres et assurant à la fois la protection des novateurs hétérodoxes et la circulation de leurs travaux. La comparaison avec la Chine achève de faire ressortir cette particularité européenne. En dépit de niveaux d'activité intellectuelle et technologique similaires, la version chinoise des Lumières est demeurée sous le contrôle de l'élite dirigeante, là où le polycentrisme européen a permis son expression indépendante. Combinant histoire économique, histoire des sciences et des techniques et histoire intellectuelle, Joel Mokyr montre, contre le préjugé selon lequel les idées ne sont que le reflet de l'infrastructure matérielle, comment la culture, les croyances, les valeurs ont été le facteur décisif de la transformation sociale. Un nouveau regard sur les racines de la modernité qui éclairera tous ceux qui s'interrogent sur la place que l'économie a prise dans notre monde.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

The fight to control RJR Nabisco during October and November of 1988 was more than just the largest takeover in Wall Street history. Marked by brazen displays of ego not seen in American business for decades, it became the high point of a new gilded age, and its repercussions are still being felt. The ultimate story of greed and glory, Barbarians at the Gate is the gripping account of these two frenzied months, of deal makers and publicity flaks, of an old-line industrial powerhouse that became the victim of the ruthless and rapacious style of finance in the 1980s. Written with the bravado of a novel and researched with the diligence of a sweeping cultural history, here is the unforgettable story of the takeover in all its brutality.

Écrit à l’aube de la première révolution industrielle, en complément de la fameuse “Fable des abeilles”, ce texte clé a infusé toute la pensée économique moderne, d’Adam Smith à Friedrich Hayek.
“Fini l’amour du prochain !” déclare Bernard de Mandeville. Il faut désormais s’en remettre à ceux qu’il appelle “les pires d’entre les hommes”, ceux qui veulent toujours plus quels que soient les moyens employés.
Trois siècles plus tard, il s’avère qu’aucune autre idée n’a autant transformé nos vies. Le monde est infiniment plus riche. Mais le prix à payer en est exorbitant : aggravation des inégalités et altération des conditions de vie sur terre. Dans cette fine analyse, Dany-Robert Dufour décèle toutes les failles d’un système qui a longtemps montré sa supériorité, mais qui pourrait bien nous faire tout perdre aujourd’hui.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png

Jürgen Kocka,"Capitalism, in its various forms, in a central theme of modern and contemporary history, with ramifications for almost every aspect of life. This is an extraordinarily wide-ranging collection of essays by leading historians exploring the remarkable breadth of topics that have been, and ought to be, considered under the rubric of capitalism. Written from a variety of methodological and ideological perspectives, the essays not only survey the rich recent historical literature on the subject, but suggest new paths for future inquiry. A volume that will be a great aid to all those who write and teach about the subject. --Jerry Z. Muller, author of The Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Western Thought and Capitalism and the Jews

We cannot understand our world and its past without questioning capitalism. With no preconceptions, and with the greatest clarity and skill, leading world historians come together in this volume to produce a new global history of capitalism. Key topics such as finance, labour, business and enterprise in Europe, the USA, Africa, Asia and Latin America and the connections between them are carefully presented.

C’est dire que le diagnostic posé par Michel Hau et Félix Torrès comble cette lacune regrettable. ― Libération Published On: 2020-12-24

Tom Baldwin,"THE FT'S PICK FOR 'WHAT TO READ AHEAD OF THE JULY 4 BALLOT'
'As well as being very well written, Baldwin obtained considerable access and he presents a compelling picture of what Starmer is like, and in particular how he was brought up. If you admire Starmer, you should definitely read it. And if you don’t like him, you should read it anyway, because he could be PM for the next 10 years and it may be a very long time before anyone produces a better or fairer account of what makes him tick'
ANDREW SPARROW, GUARDIAN
'It tells us much we need to know about the man who will be prime minister… The access is so comprehensive and his subject so uncharacteristically candid that exploring this private world can almost feel prurient… At times it is unclear whether Starmer grasps the significance of what he has done in cooperating with this biography’
PATRICK MAGUIRE, THE TIMES
'This story, told with sensitivity and simplicity, offers readers an insight into the question voters across Britain will ask this year: who really is our possible next prime minister? The picture painted of Sir Keir’s motivations and make-up is skillfully done, with all the nuance kept in; [it will] engage any reader hoping to understand the man who may be running Britain come the end of the year'

Dana Mattioli,"""Wall Street Journal reporter Mattioli debuts with a blistering exposé of how Amazon used its 'size, leverage, and access to data across industries to choke competition.' Mattioli’s impressive reporting—which draws on internal documents and hundreds of interviews with employees, senior executives, and government officials—recreates the company’s conquests in disturbing detail....This is investigative journalism at its finest.""―Publishers Weekly (starred review)

“Riveting, shocking, and full of revelations, The Everything War is the thrilling account of how Amazon redefined corporate power, and did so with a single minded focus on rolling over the competition in its pursuit for dominance. This one could be a classic.”
―Bryan Burrough, co-author of Barbarians at the Gate and Forget the Alamo

""An unflinching expose of thuggish strategies employed by Amazon—tactics that not only hobble competitors, exploit paying customers, but also cripple aspiring start-ups that make the mistake of sharing product secrets, only to find Amazon knock-offs sold on the consumer monolith’s website.""―Jacquie McNish, co-author of Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry

""A riveting and explosive work of investigative reporting that will stand as a classic. Dana Mattioli has managed to unearth the deepest secrets of the world’s most powerful retailer, bringing it all into the daylight in vivid detail. Every page is revelatory and the characters—from the domineering billionaire CEO, to the brilliant 30-something trustbuster in Washington who pursues him—seem like they’ve walked straight out of a novel. This is the business story of our time.""―Christopher Leonard, New York Times bestselling author of Kochland and The Lords of Easy Money

""Dana Mattioli’s The Everything War is a masterful expose of a corporate leviathan’s relentless drive for power. Her incisive writing and thorough reporting takes you behind a global juggernaut’s seemingly innocuous facade. You will never look at those little cardboard boxes on your doorstep the same way again.""―Zeke Faux, author of Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall

""In The Everything War, the journalist Dana Mattioli shows us at length that Bezos’s legacy is far more insidious than we ever suspected....At this point, continuing to defend Amazon’s business practices with the argument of low prices, even when such toxicity extends to a soul-crushing work culture, has turned into a feel-good illusion that corporate America keeps telling itself about the monster it has created. But as with all illusions, at some point, reality hits. This book is exactly the dose of reality Americans need to imagine a world without Amazon, which already costs us so much to feed.""
―Karina Montoya, Washington Monthly

""There’s an echo here of Ida Tarbell, the journalist whose revelations about Standard Oil’s monopolistic chicanery led to the famous antitrust case over a century ago. As the Wall Street Journal’s Amazon correspondent (a post whose very existence speaks volumes), Mattioli’s reporting came to focus on allegations of the company’s anti-competitive behaviour, and it is the many eye-stretching case studies that are the meat of the book…The Everything War makes a compelling case that no company should be this powerful.""―Jonathan Ford, The Financial Times

“This is the most in-depth investigation ever written about Amazon […] The testimonies and revelations will be used for what will likely be the biggest antitrust trial of the 21st Century.”―Karlin Lillington, Irish Times Review",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png
