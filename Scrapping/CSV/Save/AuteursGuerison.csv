Gisele Bündchen,"Introduction

Health is true wealth.

I have learned this the hard way.

My experiences have taught me that feeling good both mentally and physically is my greatest asset, because when life is difficult, it’s my health that holds me up. Being strong is something I am proud of and work hard at, and what I eat and how I eat affects my quality of life and my health more than almost anything else I do. I find happiness, contentment, and wellness through food, and I take so much satisfaction and joy in treating my body kindly. Eating nutritious food nourishes my body and feeds my soul.

When it comes to the food I love most, I turn to simplicity. I want all the benefits of real, nutritious food with no fillers or fake stuff. I also don’t want restrictions or complications from diets. Luckily, simple food—like fruits, vegetables, smoothies, occasional meat and fish—usually tastes best and is the easiest to prepare, too. Not to mention, it gives me joy. I don’t just eat to satisfy my hunger or for instant gratification—though of course both are happy by-products. Most important, I’ve found that eating simply provides me with happiness, health, energy, and well-being. This plus good sleep and a daily exercise routine improves my bodily functions, from easy digestion to physical strength to a clear mind. Food is the fuel that drives us. Eating delicious, organic, natural foods and sharing meals with my family where we all feel fully nourished and cared for are deeply meaningful to me. It makes me feel whole.

In life, you reap what you sow. If you give love, you will receive love. And if you eat well and take control of what you choose to put in your body, you will feel strong, mentally resilient, and comfortable in your own skin. But it’s a choice. It’s up to you. The consequences are yours alone, good or bad. Taking responsibility for my health changed my life, and I’m grateful for the courage and discipline it took to get to this point. Today I feel stronger than I ever did before. It was a long road to get here, but I’m so happy that here is where I am. I surround myself with positive energy. I am loving to myself. I really believe that we become what we think and what we eat.

Here is my story.
